Hughes and Salvidge Holdings Limited incorporating Hughes and Salvidge Limited (The Company) is committed to driving out acts of modern day slavery and human trafficking within its business and that from within its supply chains, including sub-contractors.
The Company acknowledges responsibility to the Modern Slavery Act 2016 (amended) and will ensure transparency within the organisation and with suppliers of goods and services to the organisation. These as well as the suppliers of services make up the supply chain within Hughes and Salvidge Holdings.
As part of the companies’ due diligence processes into slavery and human trafficking the supplier approval process will incorporate a review of the controls undertaken by the supplier. Imported goods from sources from outside the UK and EU are potentially more at risk for slavery/human trafficking issues. The level of management control required for these sources will be continually monitored.
The company will not support or deal with any business knowingly involved in slavery or human trafficking. The Company Directors and Senior Management shall take responsibility for implementing this policy statement and its objectives and shall provide adequate resources (training, etc.) and investment to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within the organisation and within its supply chains.
A copy of this policy and a copy of the Modern Slavery Act 2016(amended) will be accessible to all employees electronically and can be obtained from the Head Office upon request.
This Policy takes into account, and supports, the policies, procedures and requirements documented in our Integrated Management System, compliant with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007. The implementation and operation of this management system underlines our commitment to this policy.
Formal procedures concerning slavery and human trafficking have been established, including disciplinary procedures where they are breached. Additional procedures ensure that this policy is understood and communicated to all levels of the company, and that it is regularly reviewed by the Directors to ensure its continuing suitability and relevance to the company activities.
Hughes and Salvidge’s Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Act Policy and procedures are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis or more frequently in response to specific events or a change in regulations or good industry practise. This Statement is available to the public via the website at www.hughesandsalvidge.co.uk

Statement 2019
Our business
The Group is Australia's leading provider of integrated financial
services including retail banking, private banking, business
banking, institutional banking, superannuation, insurance, and
sharebroking products and services. The Group services more
than 17 million customers globally, and has a presence throughout
Australia, New Zealand, Asia, North America and Europe.
This statement has been produced to comply with Section 54
of the United Kingdom's Modern Slavery Act 2015. We have
expanded on the scope of this statement to reflect some of the
work that has been undertaken in the course of the reporting
year to assist us with reporting against the requirements set out
in the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) for the period ending 30
June 2020.
Our position
We believe that conducting our business in a responsible manner
and making meaningful contributions to the communities in which
we operate is critical to delivering balanced and sustainable
stakeholder outcomes. Our approach to human rights is guided
by our Group Environmental and Social Policy, which outlines
the Group's approach and commitment to managing the
environmental and social impacts of our business activities and
operations and the governance and oversight in place to support
these commitments.
We understand that slavery can occur in many forms, such as
forced labour, child labour, domestic servitude, sex trafficking,
and human trafficking. In this statement we refer to 'modern
slavery' as defined by the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth).
Our commitment to human rights
Respect for human rights underpins the way we do business.
We respect human rights, as set out in the International Bill of
Human Rights, International Labour Organisation Declaration
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and at a
minimum, abide by the human rights-related laws of the
countries where we operate.
Our commitment to respect human rights is guided by the United
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
According to these principles, governments possess the primary
duty to protect human rights; our responsibility is to respect
human rights.
We constantly strive to understand and improve human rights
impacts throughout our broader value chain and not purely
where we have operational control. However, given our scale
and diversity we are always at risk of indirect exposure to human
rights impacts, particularly via our investment and procurement
activities where more than one party may stand between us and
the rights holders affected. Accordingly, we seek to understand

2,"Persimmon Group Modern Slavery Statement
This statement sets out the steps taken by the Persimmon Group during the year ended 31 December 2016 to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains.
Introduction
Persimmon is one of the UK’s leading housebuilders. We are opposed to modern slavery and human trafficking and take this matter very seriously. We treat all of our stakeholders, including our employees, workers, subcontractors, and suppliers fairly and with respect and we will not tolerate illegal practices in our own business or in our supply chain.
Our Organisation
The Persimmon Group has 29 regional housebuilding businesses who build homes across England, Wales and Scotland. Our Space4 operating business is based near Birmingham and operates the largest automated manufacturing plant for the production of timber frames and highly insulated wall panels and roof cassettes in the UK. In addition, we are in the process of establishing a new brick manufacturing plant in Harworth, Nottinghamshire to provide a substantial proportion of the Group’s brick requirements.
Policies
We treat all of our stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, subcontractors, business partners and customers in a fair and respectful manner and uphold all basic human rights. We have various policies in place setting out how we do this, which are available on our website. [Click here]
Our Procedures
Our Own Business
We do not employ any person below the age of 16 in any of our business operations, including on our sites. As a reputable UK business, we ensure that as a minimum we comply with all relevant employment legislation, including legislation upholding minimum pay levels, legally mandated benefits, working conditions and working hours.
We have procedures in place to ensure that each of our businesses checks that all employees and labour only sub-contractors are eligible to work in the UK. We also have systems in place to ensure that our businesses adhere to our procedures and legislation. In addition to this, our Group Risk function conducts regular checks to ensure that these procedures are adhered to.
Our staff are encouraged to remain vigilant to unethical practices and we have whistleblowing procedures in place for the reporting of concerns.
Our Suppliers and Subcontractors
All of our suppliers and subcontractors are either UK entities or are UK offices of large international companies. We look to develop long term and mutually beneficial relationships with our suppliers, built on respect and honesty.

The majority of the goods we buy are produced either in the UK or in jurisdictions that have well established frameworks for stakeholder protections. A small proportion of the goods we purchase or components within goods we buy originate from geographies that do not have such well established frameworks.
We do not condone the sale and use of materials that have been obtained or manufactured from an illegal or unauthorised source. Our suppliers must agree to our terms and conditions, which includes adherence to our Supplier Principles. Our Supplier Principles specify that all suppliers must comply with all relevant labour related legislation in the countries in which they operate, including those relating to working hours, employee wages and benefits, and that our suppliers must not engage in business practices that may be considered unethical or corrupt.
We have procedures in place to obtain confirmation from our suppliers, particularly those sourcing goods from countries deemed to be of higher risk that they continue to adhere to our Supplier Principles. Our Supplier Principles are reviewed regularly.
Steps Taken
During 2016 the Group Risk function conducted a risk assessment of the processes and procedures in place within our own business and in our supply chain to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking. This assessment was reviewed by our Risk Committee, which considered that due to the low level of overseas exposure, our overall risk of non-compliance with the Act is low.
We will continue to keep our practices and procedures under review.

Volkswagen Group United Kingdom Limited (“VWGUK”) is a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales and headquartered in Milton Keynes. VWGUK is a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG (“VWAG”), and is the UK importer of certain VWAG products. VWGUK trades as Volkswagen UK, Audi UK, SEAT UK, ŠKODA UK and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles UK. Under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“Act”), VWGUK is required to publish a Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for each financial year, setting out the steps it has taken to address the risk of slavery or human trafficking occurring in its supply chain or within its own operations.
This is our second statement pursuant to the Act and represents our work completed with the financial year which ended 31 December 2017. This statement also incorporates the statement of VWAG, which sets out the global Volkswagen group’s approach, processes and principles to combat slavery and human trafficking. The VWAG statement is a global statement which is updated annually. Where applicable, VWGUK has adopted these or similar processes in its operations in the UK. For the latest version of the VWAG statement, please see here:
Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement VolkswagenAG
In addition, throughout 2017 VWGUK has taken additional steps to further combat the risk of slavery or human trafficking within its supply chain including the following:
1) The release of a new Code of Conduct in 2017 which applies to all employees and is based on shared values around honest conduct, taking responsibility, integrity and compliance with all rules and regulations (a copy is available on each of our brand websites);
2) The creation and roll out of a Modern Slavery Questionnaire to our Top 56 suppliers to better understand the risk profile of our supplier base. Throughout the course of 2018 we will also be engaging with suppliers to better understand how they manage risks of Modern Slavery and associated issues within their organisations; and
3) The continued roll out of the Volkswagen Group Supplier Code of Conduct, which has been sent to each of our 2,000 business partners as part of their contractual relationship with us;
As a business, VWGUK maintains its zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery and this is enshrined as one of the core principles of its purchasing policy. However, VWGUK acknowledges that modern slavery exists and is a risk to all businesses.
In the event that any of VWGUK’s business partners are found to be engaging in slavery or other unethical working practices, it will take steps to address those issues with this business partner, seek to drive improved standards and, if necessary, terminate its relationships with any such business partners.

Processes, policies and controls

Our policies and processes reflect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective frameworks and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we have in place processes and frameworks to:
• Identify and assess potential modern slavery or human trafficking risk areas for any new suppliers
• Reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our current supply chain.

We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking. We want to ensure that all those in our supply chain operate in accordance with our values. To do this, we have a rigorous supply chain management programme consisting of:
• Competitive and ethical sourcing
• Standard contractual terms that include a clause on compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015; appropriate action would be taken should any supplier be found in breach of this clause
• Due diligence processes that verify suppliers’ compliance with the Modern Slavery Act
• Accountable decision making
• A risk-based supply chain assurance programme that includes a review of Modern Slavery statements for applicable suppliers
• Capability training for those responsible for the sourcing, assurance and management of suppliers.

Policies

Our existing policies and procedures encourage colleagues to raise any concerns relating to the management of our suppliers or impacts on our supply chain at the earliest opportunity. We have safeguards in place to protect whistle-blowers throughout our organisation, whether their concern is internal or external, through our Whistleblowing Policy.
We are committed to continuous improvement of our policies and processes to enable a deeper understanding of our supply chain and the mitigation of risks relating to modern slavery and human trafficking.

Recruitment and training

Recruitment

Training our colleagues

HRG do not directly employ individuals as all colleagues working at HRG are employed by Argos Ltd or Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Limited. The Bank’s colleagues are employed by Sainsbury’s Bank Plc. Compliance checks are carried out in advance on all candidates offered employment. All colleagues employed by the Sainsbury’s Group undergo Right To Work checks in accordance with HMRC guidelines, the Immigration Act 2016 and our Right To Work Policy.

In order for us to address modern slavery and human trafficking, awareness is raised across our business and supply chain, so that responsibility for identification of issues are shared, rather than sitting with a smaller group of experts, or being reliant on external stakeholders. An e-learning course for all colleagues in the Bank and HRG is completed on an annual basis. The training includes guidance on modern slavery and trafficking, how to detect it and how to report it.

Risk assessment and future approach

PwC and Ergon, who together have significant data analytics capability and human rights expertise, have created a next-generation diagnostic risk assessment tool for us which can be applied across numerous different areas of our business. We are able to analyse complex sets of internal and externallysourced data, against an updated range of risk indicators to provide an aggregated risk rating for specific products and sectors within our business and supply chains.
This tool offers us unprecedented visibility to the multiple tiers in our supply chains, which is essential if we are to reach the most vulnerable workers. The tool can be applied across the entire range of Sainsbury’s Group businesses, with their very different structures and sectors. The tool supports our modern slavery risk assessment strategy, by validating the assurance oversight we deploy to our supply chain and allowing us to direct our assurance and oversight activities to the areas of greatest risk.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2019

Risk assessment and future approach

How our tool, developed with PwC and human rights experts Ergon, works:

1. Sainsbury’s data

2. Economic location modelling 3. Modern slavery risk scoring

4. MS Tool (tableau)

Compile spend, location and product/service data from business units including Food Commercial, Sainsbury’s Argos, Sainsbury’s Bank and Procurement (goods and services not for resale)

Use economic location modelling to fill gaps and unknowns in the Sainsbury’s data-set across supply chain tiers

Develop modern slavery risk index and scoring based on research and subject matter expertise

Present modern slavery risk for each business units using Tableau an interactive data visualisation software

Together with PwC we can feed new information into our tool, continually improving our approach to identifying and eliminating slavery risks in our supply chain.

We will continue to monitor and mitigate the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain in 2019/20 using outputs from this diagnostic tool, due diligence activity and ongoing assurance assessments of material suppliers.

We have also enhanced our understanding and assessment of material subcontractors in our supply chain, which enhances the depth of the modern slavery and human trafficking risk assessment. Processes are now in place to ensure our register of material sub-contractors is maintained on an ongoing basis.

We are committed to mitigating the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain in 2019/20.

12,"Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement – MAN Group
This statement is made in accordance with Section 54 of the United Kingdom’s Modern Slavery Act of 2015.
Organisation The MAN Group is one of Europe’s leading commercial vehicle and mechanical engineering groups and focuses on activities in the areas of transportation and energy — market segments that offer long-term, global opportunities. MAN’s business activities are grouped into two business areas: Commercial Vehicles, comprising MAN Truck & Bus and MAN Latin America, and Power Engineering, featuring MAN Diesel & Turbo and Renk. With a workforce of 53,824 employees, the Group operates in over 180 countries and has production sites in 14 countries. Commercial vehicles: MAN Truck & Bus AG, which is based in Munich, Germany, is the largest company in the MAN Group and one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of commercial vehicles. MAN Truck & Bus has production facilities in three European countries, Russia, South Africa, India, and Turkey. The company MAN Latin America produces trucks and buses in Resende, Brazil, and Querétaro, Mexico. In 2015, Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH, a holding company for commercial vehicles was created. The aim is to enhance the alliance of MAN Truck & Bus, MAN Latin America, most of whose sales are made through Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus, and Scania, as part of Volkswagen Truck & Bus. Power Engineering: MAN Diesel & Turbo SE, which is based in Augsburg, Germany, is one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of large-bore diesel engines, turbocompressors, industrial turbines, and chemical reactor systems. Renk is a listed subsidiary of MAN SE and a global manufacturer of special gear units, propulsion components, and testing systems. MAN holds 76 % of the company’s capital.

Internal measures
MAN Group Code of Conduct1 The MAN Group’s ethical conduct guidelines and basic compliance requirements are described in its Code of Conduct, which is binding for all employees throughout the Group. The Code of Conduct provides our employees with a practical guide, summarising the key basic principles for correct conduct and providing support should they ever face legal or ethical challenges. The observance of internationally recognized human rights forms part of this Code of Conduct. We act in accordance with the values set out in the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the declarations of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
The MAN Group Whistleblower System2 The Speak up! whistleblower portal serves to detect and prevent material risks to MAN. With this portal, MAN offers employees and business partners the option of providing tip-offs about serious legal infringements confidentially. This information is investigated in detail. Violations are dealt with and punished according to the penalties permitted under labour law. The Speak up! whistleblower portal acts as a means of both recognizing and avoiding considerable risks for the Company.
Qualification of employees By taking preventive measures, we promote compliance with regulations in our organisation and raise the awareness of our employees. This is why information and employee training plays a key role in compliance work across all hierarchy levels. We hold trainings on compliance issues worldwide for MAN employees who may be exposed to compliance risks. Employees learn how they should act in order to avoid legal violations and conflicts. All employees joining MAN Group are obliged to complete an online tutorial about the Group’s Code of Conduct and, in addition to this, there are special training sessions on specific issues for employees working in areas that are particularly at risk. The topic of human rights is also part of the Code of Conduct online training course.

Page 2/6

Furthermore, employees are able to access and print other online Code of Conduct related material.
Risk analysis As part of the established risk management processes, risk assessments on the subject of human rights are also carried out by the Group's key divisions and companies, including the countermeasures taken. The results of the risk assessments are reviewed annually enabling MAN to check the adequacy of its compliance program.
Measures in the supply chain
Sustainability requirements for our suppliers and business partners 3 MAN expects its suppliers, business partners, and their employees to act responsibly and to adhere to the laws in force and ethical principles everywhere and at all times. That is why MAN has issued its own Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Business Partners, which prescribes the minimum ethical standards that they must adhere to. By acceding to the United Nations’ Global Compact, MAN has undertaken to observe its ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. Furthermore, MAN meets the labour standards laid down in the Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO). MAN has also set itself binding guidelines in its Code of Conduct for acting responsibly. Moreover, the “Volkswagen Group requirements for sustainable development with regard to the relationships with business partners (Code of Conduct for Business Partners)” apply to MAN and are thus extended to MAN’s suppliers.

Page 3/6

Training and monitoring of suppliers
To facilitate ongoing supplier development, in the course of our business relations we make an electronic learning (e-learning) module on sustainability available to all. Alongside the e-learning format, we also conduct topic-specific sustainability training courses and workshops with our suppliers at selected locations. We use various tools to test the suppliers’ compliance with our sustainability requirements. This includes a thorough self-assessment questionnaire (aligned with other European based OEMs), as well as performing Third-Party-Audits at supplier locations in order get a proof of the alignment with the out Sustainability Requirements.
Risk analysis
The Volkswagen Group uses country-specific risk analysis to get an assessment of social or ecological risks or risks related to human rights at the respective locations prior to negotiations with potential suppliers. The risk analysis incorporates data from third parties as well as internal experience. On this basis, countries such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico and Russia have been identified as having a higher risk of non-compliance with our sustainability requirements. In supplier development, we therefore place special focus on these countries. To identify current developments as well as longterm structural challenges in each country, we rely on the ongoing exchange of information between the brands and the regions at the regular meetings and videoconferences held by the sustainability procurement network.
Before entering into a business relationship, the integrity of our business partners (Business Partner Check) is checked in a risk-oriented manner.

Page 4/6

Outlook
In pursuit of ongoing improvements to its sustainability management activities, the Volkswagen Group set up a Sustainability Council in 2016. Made up of prominent experts from politics, science and public life, the Sustainability Council communicates with the Board of Management, top management and employee representatives on a regular basis and provides unbiased advice on related issues. The Sustainability Council is free to define its own procedures and set its own priorities. Alongside sustainable mobility, climate protection, the future of work, and digitisation, the Council also deals with questions of social responsibility and integrity. To incorporate further insights into human rights issues and the opinions of independent external experts in our corporate strategy, we organise regular stakeholder dialogues attended by representatives from NGOs, science and politics. Our company will show the same intolerance towards human rights violations in the future as well. Because we regard such violations as a dynamic risk, we will align our monitoring procedures with ongoing developments and continue to raise awareness of forms of modern-day slavery and human trafficking both inside and outside the company. One such measure will be to refine our Code of Conduct for Business Partners by adding modern-day slavery and human trafficking as examples of human rights’ abuses. The group companies will maintain a process by which we aim to ensure that slavery, servitude, forced compulsory labour and human trafficking do not feature in anything we do.
Page 5/6

To help our employees recognise possible violations we have established some typical ‘red flags’ (this is not an exhaustive list) and MAN also recognises the fact that some of these indicators may not necessarily show that a person is a victim of slavery. Often an awareness of a person’s circumstances may indicate there is a problem.
- The person is not in procession of their passport, identification or travel documents.
- The person is acting as if they are being instructed or coached by someone else.
- The person is withdrawn or appears frightened. - The person does not seem to be able to contact
friends or family freely. - The person has limited social interaction or contact
with people outside their immediate environment. MAN will request that all employees should report any suspicions regarding human rights, slavery or human trafficking violations without delay, however MAN is also mindful of the fact that some victims may not want to be helped. In addition, reports should be handled with sensitivity as a report could potential put the victim at further mental or physical risk. MAN will offer guidance on the reporting methods and instructions on what action to take if someone is in immediate danger.

13,"MODERN SLAVERY ACT: ANTI-SLAVERY STATEMENT
This statement is made under section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It constitutes the Regus group's (the “Group”) anti-slavery and human trafficking statement.
The Group has zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking and is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. We seek to act ethically in all our business relationships and we have started to take appropriate steps to ensure that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains. These steps include:
 requiring new suppliers to declare that they are not involved in modern slavery or human trafficking and confirm that they do not to (i) employ or use any labour in contravention of the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015; and (ii) purchase any resources and or materials that have been sourced from entities using forced labour; and
 requiring that suppliers implement and maintain due diligence procedures for its own suppliers, subcontractors and other participants in its supply chains, to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its supply chains.
We strive to take all reasonable and practical steps to ensure that our standards are being implemented throughout the businesses of our suppliers and that local legislation and regulations are complied with. We will assess any instances of non-compliance on a case-by-case basis and will then tailor remedial action appropriately. We will only trade with those who fully comply with this policy or those who are taking verifiable steps towards compliance.
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk (including in relation to that of human trafficking and slavery) we operate a range of policies and procedures within the Group. These include the policies and procedures in relation to whistleblowing, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery.
This statement has been approved by our Board of Directors, who will review and update it as necessary on an annual basis. Unless updated, this statement constitutes our Group's slavery and human trafficking statement for all future financial years until it is modified or amended.

This statement sets out the Company’s commitment to preventing slavery and human trafficking in our business activities and the steps we have put in place with the aim of ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our own business or in those of our external contractors and suppliers. We all have a duty to be alert to risks, however small. Staff are expected to report their concerns and management are expected to act on them. Our Business The Company is a global loss adjusting company, handling claims and managing other risks operating worldwide and has in excess of 1200 employees.

to Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions, a Business Code of Conduct and Whistleblowing. Further, this statement sets out our expectation that our suppliers shall ensure that they do not condone, nor are they involved with, Slavery or Human Trafficking in any form. This also applies to any 3rd party supplier that is used in providing services or products indirectly to the Company. Training and Awareness Raising staff awareness of the Modern Slavery Act is integral to maintaining our standards of expected behaviours. The Company will ensure that:
Our staff are aware of the Modern Slavery Act; and Staff are aware of what they should do if they suspect a case of Slavery or Human Trafficking and that they can use the Whistleblowing Policy to report concerns.

MODERN SLAVERY ACT – BERRY GARDENS SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2018
BerryGardens is an international fruit marketing and distribution company, sourcing products globally. We are grower owned and work with suppliers world-wide. We recognise there is scope in our supply chain for slavery and human trafficking to occur. BerryGardens takes a zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking. We aim to educate our staff and supply chain by:
Working closely with, and supporting the GLA. Keeping up to date with current trends on the subject. Educating our managers and Labour Providers on how to spot those who may be vulnerable.

20,"Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
This statement applies to Ed Broking LLP, in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2018.
Organisation
Ed Broking Group is an independent, mainly wholesale insurance and reinsurance broking group with offices across the world. However, the main legal entity carrying out business in the UK is Ed Broking LLP. It receives (re)insurance business from (re)insurance brokers internationally and places that business predominantly into the Lloyds and London company markets, with a smaller proportion placed both with (re)insurance companies internationally.
Our commitment
Ed Broking is strongly opposed to slavery and human trafficking and will not knowingly support or conduct business with any organisation involved in such activities. We are committed to collaborating with stakeholders to improve transparency and address incidents of slavery or human trafficking identified.
Risk assessing our supply chains
As we are predominantly wholesale (re)insurance brokers, we have simple supply chains, comprising of other (re)insurance brokers and financial and professional services organisations; these are considered to be low risk, in terms of slavery or human trafficking.
We are committed to the highest professional standards and ethics, and we expect the same high standards from all parties we work with, as well as their compliance with all local laws and regulations. This includes outsourced providers of ancillary services, such as cleaning, catering, etc.
We aim to identify and assess key risk areas in our supply chains. Should we identify slavery or human trafficking activities in our supply chains we will work to remediate that through appropriate and proportionate action in accordance with our legal and moral obligations.
Our Employees

Our working practices respect and uphold internationally recognised human rights for our partners, employees and contractors.
Reference to our commitment to prevent slavery and human trafficking is incorporated in training for all Ed Broking group employees. This will ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of slavery and human trafficking in supply chains and the business in general.
Ed Broking has a whistleblowing policy that encourages all employees to report any suspected concerns regarding unethical behaviour.
Due Diligence
Our insurance supply chain is subject to a rigorous account opening process which, involves checking of entities, and in some cases company directors, against sanction lists, financial crime and criminal offences. Additional checks are performed for parties in ‘high risk’ territories (according to Transparency International’s widely used ‘Corruption Perception Index’).
Relationships with the few ancillary service providers employed by Ed are supported by established contractual agreements, with UK-based companies. The main provider (cleaning services) has their own, up-to-date, ‘Modern Slavery Statement’.
We also complete rigorous background checking of new employees, within one month of their start date. All new employees undertake a programme of induction training, that includes company standards and ethics.
Training for Employees
Our commitment to prevent slavery and human trafficking is underpinned by ethics training for all Ed Broking group employees. This will be enhanced in 2019 by introduction of specific ‘Modern Slavery’ training, developed by the Chartered Institute of Insurance. This will ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of slavery and human trafficking in supply chains and the business in general.
Policies and Working Practices
Our working practices respect and uphold internationally recognised human rights for our partners, employees and contractors.

All Ed Broking staff make quarterly attestations that they adhere to all company policies. Ed Broking LLP does not currently have a Modern Slavery Policy , due to the assessed low level of risk within our supply chain. Additionally, Ed Broking has a comprehensive whistleblowing policy that encourages all employees to report any suspected concerns regarding unethical behaviour. Review This statement is made and, will be updated each year, pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The statement has been approved by the board of Ed Broking LLP.

DBS Bank's Statement on Modern Slavery
This Statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, a UK
legislation, and sets out the steps DBS Bank Ltd (DBS) has taken to identify and mitigate
the risks of modern slavery in our organisation and supply chains. This Statement is for the
financial year ending 31 December 2016.
DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia headquartered in Singapore. We have
over 280 branches across 18 markets, with key franchises in Singapore, Hong Kong,
China, Taiwan, India and Indonesia.
DBS is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, reflecting our commitment to
promulgate good practices and align our operations and strategies with universally
accepted principles in human rights, including the elimination of all forms of forced and
compulsory labour. We will initially assess suppliers engaged by our business operations
in Singapore to ensure modern slavery is not taking place in our supply chains and,
subsequently, extend the assessment to our overseas locations.
We aim to partner with suppliers which adopt good ethical, professional and legal
standards. DBS established the DBS Sustainable Sourcing Principles (SSP) in 2015, and
generally requires its suppliers to conduct their activities in accordance with the SSP. The
SSP is one facet of DBS' overall sustainability agenda, which underpins our fundamental
commitment to respect human rights. Details of our sustainability agenda, values and
plans are set out at pages 108 to 115 of our 2016 Annual Report.
The SSP outline DBS' expectations of our suppliers in four key areas - human rights
(which includes human trafficking and slavery), safety and health, environmental
sustainability and business integrity and ethics.
We have also included in our template sourcing and service contracts the relevant
contractual clauses where suppliers in Singapore acknowledge DBS' conduct of business
in accordance with the SSP and that they will conduct their business in compliance with
applicable laws, including those dealing with modern slavery. Our supplier management
process requires due diligence to be performed not only at the new supplier registration
stage, but also at regular intervals after the contractual relationship commences.
We plan to roll out similar due diligence and SSP adherence processes in phases across
We value our employees and treat all, regardless of rank, gender or race with parity,
dignity and respect. Through our recruitment principles, we ensure that our hiring practices
are in compliance with applicable employment laws with a holistic approach to talent
acquisition, development and retention. We actively invest in supporting the health and
well-being of our employees. Through our Code of Conduct, we set out clear principles and
minimum standards of behaviour expected of each employee, which includes treating
others in a professional, ethical and responsible manner.
We currently operate a comprehensive policy framework, where various aspects of modern
slavery are addressed. These include:
Suppliers
Sustainable Sourcing Principles
Our pursuit for upholding human rights
Our procurement teams are trained and aware of the SSP. DBS has a Speak Up Policy
and framework that allows employees and third party contractors, including suppliers, to
report confidentially any unethical business concerns including human trafficking and
slavery. In subsequent years, we intend to raise more awareness on modern slavery
throughout the functions and divisions in Singapore and our overseas locations.

Introduction Ark Syndicate Management Limited (“ASML”) is committed to combating all forms of slavery, human trafficking and forced labour. The ASML Board and senior management believe that, because of the nature of ASML’s business and the related supply chains, the risk of the company becoming involved in the support or encouragement of slavery, human trafficking or forced labour is minimal.
ASML’s human resources, outsourcing and compliance policies and procedures are designed to ensure that the company is supportive of its employees and contractual staff at all times. The company’s suppliers and business partners are expected to operate to a similar level of high ethical and business standards.
Organisational Structure ASML is incorporated in the UK and employs a total of approximately 120 permanent staff. ASML’s ultimate parent company is Ark Insurance Holdings Limited, incorporated in Bermuda.
Business Operations ASML is a managing agency for Lloyd’s Syndicates ARK 4020 and NOA 3902. The business consists entirely of underwriting insurance and reinsurance, along with associated management and claims activities. ASML does not act as a producer or retailer of physical goods, and has no supply chains relating to such activities. As part of the service industry, ASML relies heavily on people and intellectual property rather than physical assets, therefore ASML invests in its people and that of its business partners and suppliers.
Supply Chains As a provider of insurance and reinsurance solutions, the company’s supply chains are very limited. ASML outsources some functions relating specifically to the support of underwriting and claims activities to reputable professional firms (including IT, internal audit, HR and investments), and indirectly utilises the services of third parties for office management (including security and cleaning).
As a Lloyd’s market participant, ASML makes use of a number of central services, including market processing, Lloyd’s corporation oversight and banking arrangements. Each of these is subject to Lloyd’s central negotiation and review, which will include a review of the policies and procedures of each of these suppliers.
Policy on Slavery and Human Trafficking ASML aims to ensure that there is no slavery, human trafficking or forced labour in any part of its business or supply chains. This reflects the company’s determination to act ethically and with integrity in its relationships with suppliers and business partners, and to promoting the same high standards in their own operations.
ASML operates a sophisticated set of risk management policies and procedures designed to identify and mitigate a wide range of risks, including the company’s Outsourcing Policy, Whistleblowing Policy, Compliance Policy and Financial Crime Policy.
Training and Awareness In order to promote awareness of the risks of slavery and human trafficking, management will communicate this policy to all ASML staff, include it as part of the induction materials provided to all new employees and make it available on the ASML website.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017

This Statement outlines the steps we have taken in the last twelve months to prevent or address slavery and human trafficking in our business.

This is our second Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement1. It is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 and applies to Lloyds Banking Group plc, its subsidiaries, employees and officers of the Group for the financial year ending 2017.
This Statement was approved by the Boards of Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc in February 2018.
It outlines the steps we have taken in the last twelve months to prevent or address slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chain, including:
•• Raising colleague awareness of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking (see page 4)
•• Contributing to efforts to combat modern slavery and human trafficking through financial crime prevention mechanisms (see page 5)
•• Building on our processes that relate to modern slavery and human trafficking (see page 6)

We have a zero tolerance approach to slavery, trafficking or forced labour in any part of our business or supply chain. We aim to align our activities and policies with international best practice and recognised standards. We are either a signatory to, or abide by, the principles of a number of international and national codes and standards relating to responsible business practice. These include: The Equator Principles, the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, the UN Global Compact, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the ILO (International Labour Organisation) labour standards.
Our corporate governance structure ensures that colleagues are supported to work responsibly and manage risk effectively. This structure includes our Board and our Board-level Responsible Business Committee. It extends to every part of our business through our Group Executive Committee and Executive-level Committees.
Group Sourcing provides the framework, tools, processes and governance for all Supplier Management employees. This specialist capability and delivery is overseen by the Supplier Management Governance Committee, which is chaired by the Group Sourcing and Supply Chain Management Director. The Committee is made up of representatives from across the Group and embeds strategy and best practice.

Our Policies

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017

As outlined in our 2016 Statement, we have a number of internal Group Policies and procedures in place that reflect our commitment to operating responsibly and ethically as a business and as individual employees.

These include our internal Ethics and Responsible Business, Colleague, Sourcing, Speak Up (whistleblowing) and Anti-Bribery Policies. Each business area is required to set its strategies in line with our risk appetite and our policy requirements. Our Group Policies and associated procedures and mandatory training, were reviewed in 2017 as part of the governance of the Group’s Policy and Risk Management Frameworks. Their review reflects our efforts to continually improve our Responsible Business governance approach.
Our Code of Responsibility (the Code) provides clear guidelines for doing business fairly and responsibly, in line with our Group Values: putting customers first; making a difference together; and keeping it simple. The Code encourages colleagues to report, through Speak Up or to the Group’s Colleague Conduct Management team, any actions that are unsafe, unethical, unlawful, or not in line with Group Policies. We revised the Code in 2017 and it will be subject to a further annual review in 2018.
All employees are required to review the Code and complete Speak Up (whistleblowing) training every year as part of the mandatory training curriculum. After training they are expected to understand their responsibilities and to adhere to them every day.
In 2017, we used the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to guide the development of our Human Rights Policy Statement and the Group’s broader approach to human rights.

In our internal operations, our Pre-employment Vetting policy and Group Wide Vetting Standards, apply to all permanent and non-permanent employees that we recruit, including temporary staff and contractors. The Pre-employment Vetting process upholds our respect for labour rights. It includes the review of individuals’ proof of identity, address, and right to work in the UK. A third-party supplier manages the vetting process on our behalf and following discussions with the supplier in 2017 we established that they have controls and colleague training in place to manage their obligations under the Modern Slavery Act. We aim to ensure there is continued dialogue on these issues in 2018.
We have recognition agreements with two trade unions, Accord and Unite, which collectively negotiate on behalf of 98 per cent of our UK employees and approximately 95 per cent of employees worldwide. The Living Wage Foundation has accredited the Group as a Living Wage Employer and we review our pay rates annually to ensure minimum rates are above statutory minimum wage requirements. We have worked, and continue to work with third-party contractors and suppliers to ensure that they operate in line with our commitments. We expect our suppliers to ensure that the wages they pay meet legally mandated minimums without unauthorised deductions.
To reinforce our responsible sourcing practices, our internal Sourcing Policy states that:
•• The Group has no appetite for unethical treatment of our suppliers
•• All colleagues engaged in sourcing must follow the defined Business Sourcing Process
•• All colleagues must undertake sourcing in line with the requirements of the Group Ethics and Responsible Business Policy

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017

Our suppliers
In 2017 we amended our Code of Supplier Responsibility, which defines what we expect from our suppliers in order to ensure responsible sourcing is integral to the way we do business. We simplified the format of the Code and revised the content to distinguish more clearly between what is expected from suppliers and what they are encouraged to do. We expect all suppliers to conform to the Code and provide us with evidence to demonstrate their approach to responsible business issues, including human rights and labour issues.
We expect suppliers to:
•• Respect the human rights of their employees and comply with all relevant legislation, regulations and directives in the countries and communities where they operate
•• Prohibit forced labour (slavery) and human trafficking in their supply chain and give their employees the right and ability to leave employment if they choose
•• Prohibit child labour
•• Ensure that wages meet legally mandated minimums without unauthorised deductions
•• Allow their employees to exercise the legal right to organise and join associations (such as labour unions)
•• Provide clear and uniformly applied disciplinary and grievance procedures including prohibiting mental, physical or verbal abuse
•• Ensure working hours are in accordance with local regulation and industry practice and voluntary overtime is at a manageable level

Our suppliers are also asked to comply with specific Third Party Supplier Policies, where applicable to the services they provide to the Group.
We include our standard modern slavery clauses in our supplier contracts and purchase orders’ standard terms and conditions. We go through an escalation and sign off process with the business to consider the risks of any particular supply contract from which these are removed. These clauses seek to manage modern slavery risks and ensure that we receive appropriate information on suppliers’ supply chains and organisations, including copies of their modern slavery statements, if applicable. Our suppliers have a contractual obligation under our standard modern slavery clauses to ensure compliance with all applicable laws that apply to their supply of goods and services to us, regardless of the jurisdiction in which they operate. This includes the Modern Slavery Act and any local legislation that is aimed at combating modern slavery.
Speak-up
We expect our suppliers to have their own whistleblowing policy and facility but suppliers and their workers can also report any incidents through our confidential Speak Up Line. An independent supplier, Expolink, manages the line and we have worked with Expolink to ensure that, if instances of modern slavery or other human rights abuses are reported, they would be identified, and effectively and sensitively investigated. During the course of the next financial year, we intend to continue regular communication with Expolink to discuss these issues, and offer training if appropriate.
In 2017 we had no reported incidents of human rights breaches, slavery or trafficking from our suppliers.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017

To raise employees’ awareness of this priority area for our business, we have developed and delivered the following training courses and guidance:

	Annual Anti Money Laundering mandatory training, which 98% of colleagues completed in 2017. This included references to human trafficking as a predicate crime and provided a specific modern slavery case study as an example.

	A mandatory e-learning course for Supplier Managers, which includes content
on modern slavery and human trafficking.

	Introductory training for all Group Sourcing colleagues on the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act and the risks of slavery and human trafficking. The content from this training is also available for colleagues to replay and to download for future reference.

	Guidance on modern slavery risks which is available through our online supplier
management portal.

 	Modern slavery and human trafficking masterclass sessions were delivered to specialist Financial Crime colleagues and Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland branch colleagues.

 	Through our membership of Transparency International (TI), and in order to raise external awareness of the links between tackling modern slavery and anti-bribery, colleagues from our Financial Crime team delivered a presentation in November 2017 to fellow TI members.

Assessing and managing risks

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017

We avoid business activities that are not aligned with our risk appetite, including risks pertinent to people. We also maintain a governance structure that ensures oversight of significant risks and provides clear, transparent and timely risk reporting of performance against all of our risk appetite measures.

This approach to risk is embedded through our Policies which provide clear minimum standards for colleagues, driving behaviours which reflect our Group Values and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
We recognise that the financial sector has an important role to play in tackling modern slavery and human trafficking, as there may be exposure through the receipt and movement of the proceeds of crime. In order to mitigate this risk we have implemented monitoring controls which will help to identify activity which may be indicative of proceeds relating to modern slavery and/ or human trafficking.
We are working with others to tackle modern slavery effectively. We are a founding member of, and active participant in, the Joint Money Laundering Taskforce (JMLIT), which was launched in 2015. The taskforce was established to tackle financial crime in partnership with the financial sector and government and has five operational priorities, one of which is human trafficking and modern slavery. The Group Fraud and Financial Crime Prevention’s Financial Intelligence Unit has made human trafficking and modern slavery a primary area of focus. In addition to addressing the cases that are identified by JMLIT, in 2017 we created our own intelligence monitoring report in order to take a proactive role in identifying potential perpetrators and/ or victims of sexual exploitation, as a form of modern slavery. We share all relevant information with the National Crime Agency as required.

Working with others
Together with other financial service providers, we support the work of the Financial Action Taskforce to rank indicators that could help to identify incidences of modern slavery and human trafficking. The Taskforce is an intergovernmental organisation that focuses on combating money laundering. We are providing input to help produce a report that will:
•• Detail recent developments in the nature and scope of human trafficking, and associated modern slavery, sexual exploitation, and forced labour, and the laundering of proceeds from this crime, as well as any identifiable links with terrorist financing.
•• Provide new, more precise risk indicators: to update risk indicators that assist the private sector (particularly, banks and Money or Value Transfer Services) in financial transactions or flows associated with detecting human trafficking networks, and associated modern slavery, sexual exploitation, and forced labour.
•• Identify good practices: initiatives and mechanisms to detect, deter, disrupt, and investigate human trafficking networks and offences, and associated modern slavery, sexual exploitation, and forced labour, utilising financial information and intelligence.

Assessing and managing risks continued

Our Suppliers
We subscribe to the Financial Supplier Qualification System (FSQS) in order to standardise and manage our approach to compliance and assurance, which forms an iintegral part of our sourcing process. We take a risk-based approach and annually require our top 1,200 suppliers with a spend greater than £25,000 to self-attest. As part of the FSQS, they are asked to provide evidence of processes and procedures for assessing and complying with relevant human rights legislation and standards, including the Modern Slavery Act. It is a mandatory requirement for suppliers to complete the FSQS questions, and employees that manage the supplier relationship (Supplier Manager) must confirm that it is done satisfactorily throughout the duration of the contract.
Our Supplier Managers help suppliers complete the FSQS process annually. If a supplier provides a non-compliant answer to any Responsible Business question, generating a ‘red flag’, our Supplier Managers are required to agree a remediation plan. If the issue is deemed serious or cannot be resolved in a reasonable timeframe, we may undertake a review of the terms of the contract.
In addition to the Annual FSQS process, our Group Sourcing Supplier Assurance team conducts an annual programme of reviews on a subset of our suppliers. Suppliers that trigger our agreed risk criteria may be selected for an onsite Supplier Assurance visit by Group Sourcing. This visit will test their adherence to the applicable Group Policies and may include an assessment of the Ethics & Responsible Business test plan if appropriate. In 2017, there were no identified cases of modern slavery or human trafficking from the onsite supplier visits.
In 2017, we worked with our third-party supplier information management solutions provider and members of the FSQS community to further enhance the questions used to assess suppliers in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking and elicit additional information about the policies, standards, training and risk assessment processes that suppliers have in place.

Building on our process last year, we mapped our supply chains in 2017 to assess risk in particular geographies and sectors. We found that the majority of our direct suppliers represent a low risk of modern slavery. Over 70 per cent of our external supplier spend is in low risk sectors, such as management consultancy, legal, HR, IT, marketing and communication. The remaining spend is in operations, property and travel, and customer products. 94 per cent of our direct suppliers are located in the UK, 4 per cent in other European countries, 1 per cent in North America and the remaining 1 per cent in other countries, including India, Israel and Hong Kong. According to the Global Slavery Index 2016, 99 per cent of our suppliers are in geographies that are considered low risk for modern slavery.
Areas of Focus
Based on geography, sector and spend, we identified the following areas of focus:
•• Product sectors such as cleaning, catering, property and security: recognising that these sectors are potentially higher risk, we have consolidated these under one managed service agreement to enable us to better manage this risk. The supplier is based in the UK, and a dedicated Supplier Manager supports this relationship.
•• Supplier of uniforms: we have a single UK-based provider of uniforms. Following engagement with this supplier, it has confirmed that it takes its responsibilities in relation to modern slavery seriously and is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and SEDEX. It is managed by a dedicated Supplier Manager.
•• Suppliers in India: our suppliers in India, including IT providers, are large global firms which have undergone rigorous due diligence and are managed by dedicated Supplier Managers.

Looking ahead

We will continue to monitor, embed and evolve the way we identify and mitigate modern slavery and human trafficking risks in our business and supply chain. In particular, we will continue to focus on raising awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking amongst key stakeholders, expanding our efforts to combat modern slavery and human trafficking as a financial crime, and building on our risk assessment processes.
We plan to review and report on the following indicators to assess the effectiveness of our actions: •• Number of colleagues trained on slavery
and trafficking. •• Number of reports of modern slavery through

their field. Across our direct supply base our supply chain focuses on the fulfilment of
claims across our key product areas.

standards which ban the use of child labour and forced compulsory or bonded
labour (including where the threat of penalty or discipline is used to compel work),

conditions, a living wage should be pald, working hours are not excessive and abuse
and intimidation are prohibited.
Following the Introduction of the Act, we revised our Ethical Code for Suppliers to
show our expectation that our suppliers ensure that they are taking appropriate steps
to prevent modern slavery from occurring within their own business and supply chain.
Our Ethical Code is something we will continue to revisit on a regular basis to ensure
that It reflects our current position on the topics included and how that flows through
to our expectations of our supply base.
We have communicated these changes in our Ethical Code for Suppliers to our key
direct supplier base, directing them to publicly available guidance around modern
slavery and what suppliers should be looking for.

27,"Modern Slavery Statement
Introduction
Ringtons Limited (“the Company”) is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking occurring in any of its corporate activities, as well as seeking to ensure that our supply chains are also free from such practices.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps the company has taken in the financial year ending June 2016 to prevent Modern Slavery in our business and supply chains and those we are working to implement.
Our organisational structure and operations
The principal activities of Ringtons Limited are;
 Sourcing, blending and packing of tea and infusion for its own brand and a variety of other customers
 Blending, roasting and packing coffee for its own brand and a variety of other customers
 Sourcing gifts and other food or drink items to be sold under the Ringtons brand.  Retailing products to UK retailers and directly to households via sales vans,
primarily throughout north and central England 
Policy relating to Modern Slavery
Our Modern Slavery policy reflects our intention to act ethically and with integrity in all our business activities and relationships and our commitment to fully comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA); opposing modern slavery in all its forms and preventing it by whatever means we can.
Policy Implementation: To Date
 We have begun (and will continue) implementing systems to encourage the reporting of concerns by the Company’s employees. To this end, we have established a whistleblowing procedure for employees to report any concerns.

 We have begun (and will continue) to train all relevant staff on the requirements of the Act and how to recognise and deal with incidences of Modern Slavery. Our technical team have attended training workshops run by Stronger Together.
 We continue to foster long-term, ethical business relationships with our key suppliers and are committed to only buy from tea estates and producer groups that are participating in the ETP Programme. The ETP monitors suppliers’ performance against the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code, which covers labour and human rights on tea estates.
Policy Implementation: Going Forward
 We will publish an advice note to our core supply chain members (across tea, infusions, packaging, services, gift items etc.) that sets out our obligations under the MSA and the implications of this. It will also provide for a reporting structure for any infringement or potential infringement.
 We will attempt to gain an understanding of the measures taken by all of our perishable raw material suppliers to ensure modern slavery is not occurring in their businesses or supply chains. Where possible, we will seek copies of our suppliers’ statements on slavery, which will be taken as evidence that the organisation is starting to address this important issue and that we can assume their compliance with the MSA.
 We will conduct a risk assessment of our UK operations to identify areas where Modern Slavery is most likely to occur. We will raise awareness of Modern Slavery and its indicators in the areas identified by this risk assessment.
Reporting Modern Slavery
Modern slavery is a criminal offence under the MSA. The Company’s Whistleblowing Procedure is intended to provide guidance on how concerns can be communicated to the Company. Concerns about suspected modern slavery associated with the Company or our suppliers may be reported by employees in this manner. The Whistleblowing Procedure applies to employees and may be found in the Company Policy Manual and the Company’s intranet site.

Our commitment to human rights and zero tolerance approach to modern slavery

The Westpac Group believes in respecting human rights in everything we do. Accordingly, we have zero tolerance for all forms of modern slavery and human trafficking.
The Westpac Group is a signatory to a number of international covenants and compacts on

human rights, including the UN Global Compact, which stands for, among other things, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour and the abolition of child labour. Our approach to human rights is further guided by the UN Guiding Principles on

2016 Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement

Business and Human Rights and is set out in our Human Rights Position Statement and 2017 Action Plan.
Supporting our Human Rights Position Statement, we have a number of principles, policies and frameworks in place to assist in mitigating human rights risks in our business and supply chains, including:
 Principles for Doing Business, which set out how we aim to conduct ourselves, including in the areas of governance and ethics, employee practices and supply chain management.
 Operating principles and policies, which include our:
o Code of Conduct, which sets out our expectation that all of our employees comply with applicable laws and act with honesty and integrity at all times;

o Whistleblower Protection Policy, which aims to encourage reporting of suspected or actual wrongdoing; and
o Economic and Trade Sanctions Policy.
 Procedures aimed at ensuring that all of our staff work under conditions that meet the employment standards and laws of the countries in which they operate.
 Sustainable Supply Chain Management Code of Conduct and Framework (respectively, the “Supply Chain Management Code” and the “Supply Chain Management Framework”) (available at https://www.westpac.com.au/sscm), which require that our suppliers do not participate in child labour, whether forced or involuntary, and do not otherwise breach employment laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, laws around minimum wages, discrimination, and/or harassment).
 Sustainability Risk Management Framework.

Steps taken during the financial year ended 30 September 2016

In the financial year ending 30 September 2016, the Westpac Group continued its commitment to sustainable business practices and respecting human rights, including through the activities described below:
1. We continued to apply our established standards for ethical and social business practices of suppliers through the Supply Chain Management Code and Supply Chain Management Framework. Currently, they apply to all suppliers to Westpac’s Australian operations, representing approximately 91% of our global procurement spend in 2016. We are working to extend the Supply Chain Management Code and Supply Chain

Management Framework across other geographies as described in our Human Rights Position Statement and 2017 Action Plan.
2. In line with our Supply Chain Management Code and Supply Chain Management Framework, we have undertaken due diligence and risk assessment processes to avoid involvement with suppliers where there could be the potential for breaches or abuses of fundamental human rights. Each supplier under or entering into a contract with Westpac Group in Australia is required to complete a Sustainable Supply Chain Management assessment requiring them to confirm steps they have

2

taken within their operations and supply chain to eliminate or manage their social and environmental risks focused on labour/workplace management, occupational health and safety, risk management, environment, corporate governance and ethics, supply chain and community.. Where we consider there to be residual risk, we may enter into supplier performance management or direct engagement through an action plan to monitor and manage that risk for the duration of the relationship.
3. For suppliers that have been through our sustainable supply chain management process, we include in our contracts a right to require that they submit to an independent audit of their performance against our Supply Chain Management Code and Supply Chain Management Framework.

4. We place a continued emphasis on working collaboratively with suppliers to positively influence social, ethical and environmental performance in the line with the Supply Chain Management Code and encourage our suppliers to extend the principles contained in our Supply Chain Management Code and Supply Chain Management Framework to their suppliers.
5. We offer training for our employees to ensure awareness and implementation of our relevant procedures.
6. We engage in ongoing monitoring of our procedures and review our systems to measure performance against the aims and targets set out therein with the goal of identifying where further improvements can be made.

This statement has been approved by Westpac Group’s Board of Directors, and will be reviewed and released annually.

U.K. Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement
For year ended December 31, 2017
I. Introduction
JPMorgan Chase & Co. supports fundamental principles of human rights across all our lines of business and in each
region of the world where we have a presence. We recognize that modern slavery issues, such as forced labor and
human trafficking, are a significant global challenge. We believe it is the role of government in every country to
protect human rights. We also believe that our company has a role to play in promoting respect for human rights.
To that end, this Transparency Statement, made pursuant to section 54 of the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015,
outlines the steps we are taking across JPMorgan Chase to mitigate the potential risk of modern slavery occurring in
our business and supply chain.
II. Our Organization
JPMorgan Chase is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2.5 trillion and operations worldwide.
The firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial
banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. A component of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, we serve millions of consumers in the United States and many of the world's most prominent corporate,
institutional and government clients under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands. We have a presence in more than
100 markets, including the U.K., and have over 250,000 employees worldwide.
III. Our Efforts on Human Rights and Modern Slavery
Our Firm's respect for the protection and preservation of human rights is guided by the principles set forth in the
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Further, we acknowledge the United Nations Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights (""Guiding Principles"") as the recognized framework for corporations to
respect human rights in their own operations and through business relationships.
Our Human Rights Statement outlines our commitment to support fundamental principles of human rights across
our lines of business and in each region of the world where we have a presence. In addition, our Firm-wide Code of
Conduct communicates our expectation for conducting business ethically and in compliance with the law. All
JPMorgan Chase employees are required to complete training on our Code of Conduct. Employees who become
aware of or who suspect violations of the Code of Conduct or company policy, law or regulation related to JPMorgan
Chase business, are obligated to report such concerns. This can be done through various channels described in the
Code of Conduct, including the Firm's Code Reporting Hotline (which is administered by a third party - with
translators available), Human Resources, or other appropriate resource. Where legally permissible, reporting
through the Code Reporting Hotline may be done anonymously.
In addition, we have a range of policies, procedures and training that pertain to human rights issues, including
modern slavery, across our business and supply chain.
A. Employees
As a global financial services firm, we have a broad base of employees who work across various business lines,
regions and functions to deliver products and services to our clients and customers, as well as employees who
provide expertise in risk management, technology, legal, policy and regulation, finance, accounting, controls,
human resources and many more areas. JPMorgan Chase is committed to respecting the human rights of our
employees through our internal employment policies and practices. Fostering diversity and inclusion is a
cornerstone of our corporate culture, and we strive to ensure that employees are able to work in a safe,
professional work environment. In addition, compensation and benefits, as part of our talent development
strategy, play a critical role in our ability to attract, retain and motivate our workforce. We are committed to
providing competitive and equitable compensation for our employees, and benefits that support our employees'
needs, such as health and retirement benefits and other programs to support work-life balance.
B. Suppliers
JPMorgan Chase is committed to holding ourselves and our supplier community to high standards of business
conduct and integrity. Our Supplier Code of Conduct (""Supplier Code"") sets out our principles and expectations for
suppliers, vendors, consultants, contractors and other third parties working on behalf of the Firm, as well as the
owners, officers, directors, employees, contractors and sub-contractors of these supplier organizations and entities.
The Supplier Code communicates the responsibilities of suppliers on a range of issues, including the need to
promote and respect human rights by working to prevent child and/or forced labor and human trafficking in their
operations and supply chains, and by instituting practices and operations that are consistent with the framework
provided by the Guiding Principles. This also includes an obligation to report any concern or suspected violation of
the law or regulation related to JPMorgan Chase's business or a violation of the Supplier Code.
C. Products and Services
As part of our broad effort to integrate respect for human rights into the business of the Firm, JPMorgan Chase has
various policies and procedures designed to prevent our products and services from being used for improper
purposes. Depending upon the relevance to their line of business and function, employees receive training on
various policies and procedures that pertain to products and services we provide to our clients and customers.
These include:
Policies and procedures pertaining to Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering (""AML"") and Know Your
Customer due diligence. For example, the Firm has a Global Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Program
that includes policies, procedures and internal controls designed to comply with all applicable U.S. and
international AML and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations. As part of this program, the Firm
works to help identify customers whose financial activity may show involvement in human trafficking and
communicates actionable information directly to law enforcement. The Firm is a member of the Wolfsberg
Group, an association of 13 global banks that aims to develop frameworks and guidance for the management
of financial crime risks, particularly with respect to AML and counter-terror financing policies. In addition,
the Firm participates in the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce, a public-private information
sharing forum in the U.K., which is working to understand and disrupt funding flows linked to threats such as
organized immigration crime, human trafficking and modern slavery.
Our Environmental and Social Policy Framework (""E&S Framework""), which guides our approach to assessing
environmental and social risks, including those related to human rights, for transactions and clients. The E&S
Framework outlines certain prohibited activities, including those where there is evidence of child labor or
modern slavery, such as forced labor and human trafficking. In addition, the Firm has adopted the Equator
Principles, which cover relevant human rights issues for certain asset-specific financings, including prohibition
of the use of involuntary or compulsory labor, and prohibition of child labor. In 2017, we began an effort to
identify countries and industries where there may be a greater risk for modern slavery. We will continue to",?

T&L Sugars Limited - Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement for financial year 2015/16
Our business
T&L Sugars Limited is a leading UK supplier of cane sugars and syrups. These products are produced by us at our cane refinery in East London or, in some cases, purchased directly from suppliers.
Our primary raw material is raw cane sugar. This is purchased from some of the countries with which the European Union (“EU”) has trade agreements. These EU trade agreements cover just 5% of the total amount of sugar that trades globally. Prohibitive EU import tariffs make it uneconomic for us to import from other suppliers.
The majority of our raw cane sugar supply is purchased directly from producers with whom we have long-term relationships. In a small number of cases we purchase from intermediaries.
We believe that the highest risk of modern forms of slavery in our supply chain is in raw cane sugar sourcing. This is because this supply chain includes developing economies and some seasonal work.
Our policy
T&L Sugars Limited recognises that modern slavery is an abhorrent abuse of human rights. We work to ensure any potential form of modern slavery in our own operations or within our supply chain is identified and eradicated.
Any form of forced labour, slavery or human trafficking is specifically prohibited by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Ethical Sourcing Policy (ESP). We actively police compliance with our code and ESP
by a four step process in our raw cane sugar supply chain.
Step 1 requires our suppliers to adhere to our Ethical Sourcing Policy. This is based on International Labour
Organisation conventions as well as other internationally recognized standards.
Step 2 asks every raw sugar supplier to complete an annual self-assessment of their social and ethical practices using
the Sedex Supplier Engagement platform. The assessment also covers compliance with labour, health & safety,
environmental and business integrity standards. 72 percent of our raw sugar suppliers completed this questionnaire in 2015/16.
Step 3 selects specific suppliers to participate in an independent sustainability audit against theProTerra Standard, an internationally recognized social responsibility and environmental sustainability standard. For our EU
operations, 69 percent of our cane sugar suppliers were audited in the 3-year period up to and including 2015/16 against the ProTerra standard, or certified against a comparable standard. These suppliers provided 75 percent of our EU sugar supply during that period.
Step 4 sees us encouraging and supporting our suppliers to improve in areas of non-compliance.
A number of the suppliers from which we source our sugar are Fairtrade certified. Fairtrade certification is based on regular audits of small holder operations against the Fairtrade standard which prohibits forced labour, slavery and human trafficking.

Within our own operations, our workforce is mostly permanent employees. Our use of temporary employees depends on seasonal peaks in demand for our products but has not been higher than 6% of total employees at any point during 2015/16. Our temporary employees are supplied by labour providers who, like all suppliers, are required to adhere to our Ethical Sourcing Policy which specifically prohibits modern slavery. Further, labour providers must be licensed with the Gangmasters’ Licenseing Authority, which aims to ensure employee’s rights are protected. Further, all of our own operations go through a comprehensive annual social audit performed by independent third party firm Accordia. This social audit is performed against the Sedex SMETA 4 Pillars Social Responsibility protocol, which is a formal review of a company's efforts to conduct business in a lawful, humane and ethical manner. All employees can access an internal whistle blowing line which is advertised around our sites. Training T&L Sugars Limited employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management in both sugar and nonsugar areas have undergone training run by Stronger Together, a multi-stakeholder initiative aiming to reduce hidden forced labour, labour trafficking and other third party exploitation of workers. Our 2016/17 priorities for further work on modern slavery are: 1. Continue to ensure that employees who may be in a position to spot indicators of modern slavery are independently trained on modern slavery issues and best practice. 2. Ensure employees know how to act if confronted with indicators of modern slavery in our own operations or in our supply chain. 3. Review our non-sugar supply chains to highlight any further areas of risk.

A zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking
we understand specialist banking

Modern Slavery Statement
INTRODUCTION AND POLICY STATEMENT
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”) and sets out the steps that United Trust Bank (UTB) has taken to reduce, as far as possible, the risk that slavery and human trafficking takes place in any parts of its business or supply chains.
UTB has a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking and is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all its business dealings and relationships.
UTB is also committed to ensuring that there is transparency in its business and in its approach to tackling the risk of modern day slavery throughout its supply chains. We expect high standards from all our suppliers, contractors and other business partners. Therefore, as part of our contracting process, we provide all our suppliers with details of the requirements of the Act, including the requirement not to use forced, compulsory or trafficked labour, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children. Additionally we expect our suppliers to hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.
Further, we risk assess all of our suppliers in relation to the Act’s requirements. We ask any supplier which we do not consider low risk to complete a specific questionnaire to provide evidence to us that they have considered the Act’s requirements and confirm that they are applying the Act’s requirements.
This supply chain due diligence is not only carried out initially but during the life of our supplier relationships.

Our Structure Incorporated in 1955, UTB is an entrepreneurial and fast growing UK Bank, driven to understand and serve its customers’ needs by providing customer centric products delivered by staff with specialist skills and knowledge. UTB does not have any branches or offices outside the UK.
Our Business The Bank’s primary activity is the provision of credit on a secured basis in niche markets within the United Kingdom. The Bank provides short to medium-term property loans for both the development of residential dwellings, the bridging of completed properties and property portfolios, as well as a regulated second charge mortgage product. The Bank finances plant, machinery and wheeled assets to small and medium sized enterprises (“SMEs”) and short-term working capital financing solutions to the professional services sector. All of the lending activities are funded by the Bank’s capital base and the provision of a range of fixed and notice period deposit products to individuals and SMEs.

Our Supply Chains UTB considers that within its business model the following relationship types are categorised as suppliers:
• Credit intermediaries/ credit brokers • Contractors/ employees • Housekeeping/ office maintenance • IT infrastructure, hardware and technical support • Professional services
Our Policies On Slavery And Human Trafficking UTB’s policies reflect its commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in business relationships to ensure slavery and human trafficking should not take place anywhere in its supply chains.
UTB does not allow the use of forced compulsory labour, slavery, servitude and human trafficking in the course of its business. This includes sexual exploitation, securing services by force, threats, or deception and securing services from children and vulnerable persons.

Modern Slavery Statement

Our employment procedures require that UTB conducts appropriate checks on all staff to ensure they can legally work in the United Kingdom.
In addition, all policies reflect our commitment to act ethically and with integrity and to implement effective systems and controls to eliminate as far as possible the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking taking place anywhere in our business or supply chains. Our policies are reviewed to ensure continued compliance with the Act.
In order to manage the risk of slavery and human trafficking, UTB has the following policies:
Modern Slavery Policy – this provides background to the offence, criteria for assessing risk within the supply chain and avenues for reporting suspicions.
Outsourcing and Third Party Policy – this provides the due diligence and ongoing monitoring requirements when engaging with a third party.
Conduct Risk Framework and Company Values Statement – this promotes the standards of behaviour expected of all staff.
Whistleblowing Policy- this encourages all staff to report any concerns related to the activities of the business. The Whistleblowing Policy is designed to ensure that any matter raised under this procedure will be investigated thoroughly, promptly and confidentially. Additionally, the policy guarantees that no one will be victimised for raising a matter under this procedure.
Risk Management for Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking The financial services industry in the UK is considered to be a low risk industry in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking. UTB does not have any offices or branches outside of the UK, nor does it employ low skilled migrant workers. UTB’s business model requires competent/skilled staff which prior to employment have a

series of background checks completed. The Bank has a remuneration policy which is reviewed by the Management Committee to ensure the best staff are attracted to the Bank and are retained. Overall therefore UTB considers its direct risk to modern slavery and human trafficking to be low.
In addition to our employees, we have also considered the indirect risks within our supply chain. All third party relationships are with firms in the UK and are therefore considered to be low risk based on jurisdiction. Where we consider a supplier to be in an industry where the risk of modern slavery is greater than ‘low’, appropriate steps are taken to ensure the supplier is aware and understands UTB’s expectations of them.
A governance and risk management framework is in place to support adherence to policies/procedures and to identify risks faced by the Bank, to be reasonably assured that these are monitored, and that appropriate controls are in place to mitigate each risk to an acceptable degree.
The risk management framework is based on a “three lines of defence” model which includes the front line being responsible for risk identification, assessment and mitigation; the second line providing oversight and the third line providing independent and objective assurance.
As part of UTB’s Outsourcing and Third Party relationship Policy, we carry out appropriate due diligence initially and during the life of the relationship to ensure that suppliers are as committed to the prevention of human trafficking and modern slavery as UTB.
Training To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, relevant members of staff will be notified of our policy and how it applies to their role.

For hotels that we operate we are​​committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to seek to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our business or supply chains. We are taking a continuous improvement approach to doing this, working to acquire greater transparency within our business and supply chain so that we can better understand where the risks lie and then make informed decisions about what to prioritize in implementing process designed to eliminate modern slavery from them and maintain a compliant/ethical approach.
Training We will communicate this statement to our work force as appropriate to ensure an understanding of the risk of modern slavery in our business and supply chains.
Effectiveness and performance indicators Our GLH Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets out principles that we expect all our suppliers to work within including the elimination of slavery and human trafficking, has been issued to a significant proportion of our suppliers and is available on our websites.

OCTOBER 2016
INTRODUCTION
White Stuff believes that corporate social responsibility is core to our business practice. We create products that are made with integrity and finished to the
highest standard, always working with good quality and ethical suppliers.
We’re big on the little details and we strive to genuinely connect with those around us. Creating responsibly is a key foundation to our business, and as such we
endeavour to source, produce and sell all of our products in this way.
OUR COMMITMENT
In 2015, the UK Government passed into law the Modern Slavery Act; we welcome this piece of legislation and recognise we have a responsibility to uphold our commitment to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking
throughout our organisation and in our supply-chain. People are the most important asset we have and we must ensure they are treated in a way that fully respects their human rights. We will ensure that our policies and
procedures are updated and that we have processes to enable our suppliers to learn from our values.
We will develop and deliver training, to ensure awareness and understanding of the requirements of the Act to the relevant people, including our procurement teams and the senior managers within our organisation.
Slavery is a complex issue and exists in many different forms. From adults forced to work against their will, to child labour and trafficked labour, we need to find effective methods to eradicate these practices from our supply chains and businesses, and are taking our first steps towards this, collating data by asking our suppliers specific questions about their own supply chains. Greater transparency will allow us to understand where the
risks are and, in turn, enable us to make informed decisions so we can prioritise how we approach the issue.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
White Stuff clothing and products are currently made in 16 countries across the world. 80% of our products are manufactured in China, India, Turkey and Portugal across 120 factories. These are the factories that supply
us directly, otherwise known as ‘first tier’. However, the supply chain is more complex than this, with many materials suppliers and process sub-contractors feeding into this ‘first tier’.
We regularly check our first tier factories by carrying out ethical audits at their premises. To do this we have specially trained White Stuff auditors who check our global supply base. If issues are found during an audit we
work with our suppliers to help them resolve the matter in a timely manner.
All suppliers and factories are required to demonstrate compliance to our code of conduct. New suppliers undergo initial screening and ethical audits as part of our supplier on-boarding process. We review our suppliers
performance each season in a process that not only looks at their commercial performance, but also their ethical compliance. The feedback and results are then shared with our suppliers.
We are members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and we follow their base code. We have turned their base code into our own pictorial White Stuff Code of Conduct. This code is translated into the local language and
posted inside each factory. To check their understanding of the code our auditors will interview workers during the audit process. It is through these conversations that we believe we get a credible insight into the working
conditions within each factory.
Being a member of the ETI gives us the opportunity to collaborate and work together with not only other brands, but additionally NGO’s and Trade Unions, where possible.
OUR POLICIES
Our internal policies are designed to educate and empower people to demonstrate our values. Our own business policies relating to modern slavery are: the Anti Bribery and Corruption policy; Equal Opportunities policy; Whistle Blowing policy; and Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct. Our policies are designed to help our people consistently live our values and encourage them to report any disconcerting activity. We have a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) committee that champion this and they continue to explore where we can introduce new policies and update existing policies. For example, to include our commitment to educate our people and our supply chain about the modern slavery act and our responsibility.
Our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct includes prohibiting forced labour and child labour, and, as such, we have revised our auditors’ manual to include extra checks in relation to slavery and human trafficking. In addition, each auditor has received extra training to ensure they understand their role in detecting issues.
As many issues can be hidden and difficult to uncover, we always look for ways to improve practices and increase effectiveness. We will, as necessary, further develop and implement effective auditing processes and reporting systems, and develop effective remediation programmes with respect to solving grievances where we find them.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
OCTOBER 2016
DUE DILIGENCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT
As part of our due diligence process, in relation to slavery and trafficking for our non-product suppliers, we are using a questionnaire to conduct a risk assessment that asks suppliers a series of specific questions to gather data. We will then conduct a review of all questionnaire responses by rating them high, medium or low risk and work with each non-product supplier individually to ensure compliance with our values & code of conduct.
Due to the complexities and intricacies of our product supply chain, we are delving deeper and carrying out an assessment of our supply chain risk. All of our suppliers have been given a detailed introduction to the Modern Slavery Act and its importance. Focusing on our largest first tier clothing suppliers, we are researching the extent of their second tier supply chain, which will enable us to map the results. Progress will be measured using a set of key performance indicators (KPI’s) including: number of suppliers engaged; number of supplier responses received; number of second tier suppliers mapped; number of suppliers audited; number of auditors trained; number of product team trained; number of senior managers trained. The information generated will
then be analysed and a report drawn up outlining our findings.
KEY ACTIONS COMPLETED TO DATE:

We have updated our
AUDITORS
MANUAL with reference to the Modern Slavery Act and detailed what actions the auditors can take to ensure
they are being effective when looking
for issues linked to modern slavery.

We have provided
AWARENESS
TRAINING
to our largest suppliers, internal product teams and senior managers about the act and its requirements. Our Ethical Auditors have been trained regarding the extra steps they can take to
uncover modern slavery.

We held an
INTERACTIVE
CONFERENCE
in India, which was attended by participants representing 60% of our suppliers. We introduced the modern slavery act and explored further down through the tiers in
the supply chain.

Our Ethical Trading Commitment
Working to ensure continuous improvement in our supply chain
Modern Slavery Act
Transparency in supply chains Nisbets plc is the UK's largest supplier of catering equipment. Nisbets was established in 1983 on the basic principle of high quality catering equipment aﬀordably priced. Today our products cover aprons to wine coolers and everything in between. Our corporate head oﬃce is based in Bristol, with oﬃces in Ireland, Holland, Germany, Belgium, France, Spain and Australia. We also have over 30 stores across the UK and are open to both the trade and public. We welcome the Modern Slavery Act and the requirements it places on business to publicly disclose what they are doing to tackle forced labour and human traﬃcking. With our head oﬃce in Bristol, a city that once relied on the slave trade and was instrumental in the abolishment of it in 1807, we strongly believe that we have a duty to continue this principle. Integrity is one of our core values and being open and honest with our suppliers and customers is a key part of this. We value our relationships with all our suppliers along the supply chain and understand we are only as good as the workforce producing our products. We are committed to working closely with our suppliers and to working together to root out this crime. Policy and due diligence All our suppliers are required to meet our Ethical Trading Code of Conduct, which includes the provision that workers are free to choose their place of employment. Our Code is aligned with the Ethical Trading Initiatives base code, founded on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and is an internationally recognised code of labour practice. We are transforming our supplier approval process such that all supplier sites need to register on Sedex (The Supplier Ethical Data Exchange). They must declare details of their labour practises before they can start to supply to us. Any sites assessed to have high risk are required to have an independent ethical audit. Risk assessment We understand that Modern Slavery is a criminal activity and the signs can be diﬃcult to identify and that audits only reveal a limited amount of information. We are learning and improving our understanding of the risks. We have integrated the way we manage issues raised from Social and Environmental audits into our well established Corrective Action Reporting procedure to ensure that they are resolved as quickly and eﬀectively as possible. We monitor all our suppliers through Sedex to ensure their SAQ has been completed and up to date. By using the Risk Assessment tool developed by Maplecroft, we are now able monitor the risk score (a function of location, manufacturing type and site proﬁle) and rating for each supplier and use this information, along with any social audits that may have been carried out, to further drill down to see where any issues may lie. If required, we highlight any issues to our team based in the Far East who can then arrange an on site visit and/or audit as required. We will be using a new Sedex tool to enable us to map the tiers of our supply chain eﬀectively. We need to consider not only our direct suppliers but their suppliers (and theirs etc). This does become very complex so needs careful management. Awareness and collaboration Our Ethical Trading Code of Conduct is prominent in our Colleague Handbook, as we want to ensure all colleagues are aware of it. We have developed our training program to include awareness of issues both in our international supply chains and closer to home in our temporary labour suppliers. This training will soon be available to all colleagues as part of our new training platform. We are supporting Unseens' CHIPS project (Children in a Place of Safety), a project providing highly specialist accommodation and care services to give traﬃcked children the intense support they need as they move

from harm to safety (Unseen are a charity committed to working towards a world without slavery). We also support Captivating International in the Far East, this charity helps to end potential issues of human traﬃcking through education and providing opportunity to young women, who in turn, educate their families. Modern Slavery is a global issue but it is also happening in our communities. To combat this crime, we really need to understand our complex supply chains and need to collaborate with NGOs, business, suppliers and worker groups and improve traceability and transparency.
Nisbets is a member of Sedex. Sedex is home to one of the world’s largest collaborative platform for buyers, suppliers and auditors to store, share and report on information quickly and easily. The platform is used by more than 40,000 members in over 150 countries to manage performance
around labour rights, health & safety, the environment and business ethics. Sedex is not a standard setting body and doesn’t approve or certify our policies and standards. Instead, being a member of Sedex is a sign of Nisbets’ willingness to share information and to use this information to help manage and improve ethical standards within the supply chain.

human trafficking, child labor and forced-labor in supply chains. Abbott engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk. A supplier may receive a letter, a survey or an on-site audit (usually announced ahead of time) based on this model. Information received from the supplier is then assessed to determine whether to take further steps. Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing department.
Abbott’s internal Code of Business Conduct also incorporates standards prohibiting slavery/trafficking or engaging in illegal behavior for employees and others who work for us. Abbott requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Abbott’s products comply with local and national laws of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Certifications are also obtained from suppliers that they comply with standards as outlined in our Supplier Guidelines. Abbott maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for both employees and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. In particular, Abbott employees worldwide train annually on Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct. Likewise, all contractors assigned to Abbott are required to review and abide by Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct.
Employees and contractors assigned to Abbott who fail to abide by Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct may be subject to reprimand or other adverse consequences, up to and including termination of employment or assignment.

Introduction

Modern slavery and human trafficking have no place in the world, let alone in the supply chains and operations of businesses. However, today we are all faced with the very real challenge of addressing what UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called “the great human rights issue of our time”.
21m
Victims of forced labour worldwide

The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that almost 21 million people worldwide are victims of forced labour, of which 11.4 million are women and girls, and 9.5 million are men and boys. Out of this number, almost 19 million victims are exploited by private individuals or enterprises and over 2 million by the State or rebel groups. Migrant workers and indigenous people are particularly vulnerable to forced labour mainly because of a lack of regulation – or enforcement of it – in the countries where they live or work.
The ILO acknowledges that some sectors are more exposed than others to the issue of forced labour and human trafficking; these include: construction, manufacturing, domestic work, entertainment, and agriculture.
This report, approved by our board of directors in the UK, outlines Nestlé in the UK’s approach to ensuring that modern slavery and human trafficking are not present in our operations and supply chains. Based on our risk and impact assessment processes, we know that exposure to such societal challenges is much higher in our upstream supply chain than anywhere else in our business activities.

conditions. We were one of the first companies to adopt the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) clarifying the State duty to protect human rights, the corporate responsibility to respect them and the rights for victims of human rights abuses to have access to effective remedies.
We aim to be exemplary in respecting human rights and good labour practices throughout our business activities. We believe that we have the right due diligence approach to know what the scope and depth of the issue is and demonstrate progress in addressing it. However, we believe that eliminating forced labour from agricultural supply chains requires strong collaboration between all relevant actors, with national governments taking the lead.
As Nestlé, we recognise that we are on a continuous journey and that we still have work to do. At the same time, we hope that as we move ahead, the foundations that we have established as a signatory of the UN Global Compact and early adopter of the UNGPs will support us in strengthening our ongoing commitments to upholding and respecting the fundamental human rights of all rights holders.

At Nestlé, we operate with a fundamental respect for the rights of the people we employ, do business with or otherwise interact with. We do not tolerate forced labour in our supply chain and are firmly opposed to all forms of human rights violations or poor labour

Our approach to tackling modern slavery and human trafficking
As an early adopter of the UNGPs, we follow a structured approach to improving our human rights performance across our global business activities.
This includes ensuring that we have the appropriate policies, due diligence processes and remedial measures in place to address issues such as modern slavery and human trafficking. You can read more about our Human Rights Due Diligence Programme in the Human Rights and Compliance chapter of our global Nestlé in society report.
The following sections of this document outline specific elements of our approach to managing human rights and in particular modern slavery and human trafficking, as recognized in Section 54(1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, under the Transparency in Supply Chains provision.

Assessing and managing risk

Together with external stakeholders, in early 2016 we identified a list of 11 salient issues – those human rights at risk of the most severe negative impacts through our activities and business relationships.
A number of these could be directly or indirectly linked to modern slavery and human trafficking, e.g. forced labour. We are convinced that by identifying these issues, we are better able to manage them in a proactive manner.
Cereal Partners UK & Stronger Together In 2015, as part of the Stronger Together initiative to share business’ proactive measures to address the risk of hidden modern slavery, Cereal Partners UK (CPUK), our breakfast cereal business, created an internal Stronger Together multi-function group. The group received training from the Association for Labour Providers, then set about assessing and developing a targeted business action plan to address potential risk areas for modern slavery across the CPUK business and its supply chain.

This list of 11 salient issues is based on a thorough internal and external consultation process. Internally, the first list of salient issues was proposed to our global Human Rights Working Group (HRWG) in early 2015. This list was based on the results of the Human Rights Risk Assessment Matrix 2014.

Nestlé’s Human Rights Risk Assessment Matrix 2014 builds on the company’s experience evaluating human rights issues since 2009. It is based on the results from the different monitoring tools and processes we have in place, combined with the experience of the members of the HRWG themselves, and the expert inputs from our main partners in this area, the Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) and the Fair Labor Association (FLA).

In December 2015, we held an external stakeholder convening in Washington D.C., which brought together 61 independent parties to discuss and explore how we can continue to improve on our Creating Shared Value (CSV) performance. In a separate breakout session on human rights, experts representing leading non-governmental organisations (NGOs), UN agencies, law firms, business associations and academia came together to discuss Nestlé’s ongoing human rights work and how the company can continue to improve on its current performance.
The human rights breakout session was presented with the list of salient human rights issues identified and stakeholder discussions led to a number of recommendations. These inputs have all been incorporated in the final version of the list of salient human rights issues found in this report:
• Split child labour and forced labour, which were initially combined as one salient issue. These two issues have different geographical scopes and different root causes, and should, therefore, be looked at and dealt with separately; and
• Add discrimination as an issue that cuts across all the salient human rights issues. While stakeholders understood that – based on our own data, results and experience – discrimination may not have been identified as a salient issue, they strongly suggested that this issue be incorporated into the action plans that will be developed for the 11 salient issues next year.

Co-manufactured and imported products in the UK
In order to provide a wide range of products to our consumers in the UK, some of our products are co-manufactured with partners or imported from other Nestlé manufacturing locations in Europe.
We recognise that the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking is greatest to rights holders in our supply chain, given their complexity, geographical scope and the limited operational control we have over them. For this reason, across the UK businesses we are in the process of mapping our entire supply chain, including co-manufactured and imported products. This should allow us to have a better understanding of our value chain, going beyond our direct suppliers who are already monitored through our supplier system.

These 11 salient human rights issues that we have identified span the whole of our value chain. They reflect the scope of our business activities and the potential impacts we have on the people we employ, do business with or otherwise interact.
Based on these 11 salient issues, we have identified six groups of rights holders who are particularly at risk:
• Our own employees;
• On-site contractors;
• Suppliers and, in particular, their employees;
• Farmers and farm workers;
• Local communities; and
• Consumers.

Policies

The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles shape the way we do business and they form the basis of our culture, our values and our Creating Shared Value strategy.
Principle 4, entitled ‘Human rights in our business activities’, is the foundation of our overall approach to human rights. The Corporate Business Principles were signed by Nestlé’s Chairman and CEO and released in 2010, before the UNGPs were approved by the UN Human Rights Council. E-learning on the Corporate Business Principles will be available to all employees by 2017.
Building on Corporate Business Principle 4, since 2010 we have integrated human rights elements in 17 different corporate policies and commitments. This has helped us make human rights part of our employees’ day-to-day activities and responsibilities.

Whilst we do not have a standalone modern slavery policy, we have ensured that all related aspects of this issue are represented either within specific policy commitments or integrated into broader guidance, such as in our Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé Supplier Code, and Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Guideline (RSG). This helps us ensure that we comprehensively and systematically manage this issue.
In addition to these core policies and guidance documents, in 2015 we released a new Nestlé Commitment on Labour Rights in Agricultural Supply Chains, which summarises and clarifies how we address labour-related risks in our upstream agricultural supply chains in particular. It builds upon existing Nestlé policies in this area (see table above), as well as on the existing work of our Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs), our Responsible Sourcing programme and our Farmer Connect activities, through which we source raw materials locally and directly from farmers or the associations they form.

This policy commitment has been developed to explicitly address a number of human rights issues present in some of our global agricultural supply chains, including forced and bonded labour. A roadmap for the implementation of this Commitment is currently being developed and will be made public by the end of this year. Read more about this online in the Rural Development chapter of our global Nestlé in Society: Creating Shared Value report.
In addition to our employees, all Nestlé suppliers and contractors must comply with our policy commitments, including our Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé Supplier Code, and Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Guideline. Compliance with these standards is monitored regularly through compliance and engagement processes including third-party audits, independent assessments, and contractual and relationship reviews.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Report 2016 – Nestlé in the UK

What are human rights impact assessments?
A human rights impact assessment (HRIA) is a process for identifying, predicting and responding to the potential human rights impacts of a company’s business activities either directly through its own operations or indirectly through its relationships with third parties. HRIAs use international human rights instruments as a framework to assess the potential risks to rights holders. An HRIA is very often the most comprehensive tool available to business to understand the scope, scale and nature of human rights risks in a specific country operation. Together with the Danish Institute for Human Rights we conduct specific HRIAs in high-risk countries, based on the list of Countries of Concern established by FTSE4Good. We carried out two HRIAs in 2015 (Myanmar and China) and one so far in 2016 (Egypt), taking the cumulative total conducted since 2010 to 12. We now have a new objective to complete a further six by 2018. For more information about our approach to HRIAs, as well as a summary of findings based on the first seven assessments, please see ‘Talking the Human Rights Walk: Nestlé’s Experience in Assessing Human Rights Impacts in its Business Activities’.

Due diligence

Through our Human Rights Due Diligence Programme, we implement our actions to assess, prevent and address potential human rights impacts, to improve our performance on the ground, and to gather data to measure our performance.
Human rights touch upon many different issues and functions within a given company. Through the eight operational human rights due diligence pillars of our programme, we aim to make our approach to human rights strategic, comprehensive and unified across all our business activities.

Nestlé’s eight pillars of human rights due diligence:
1.	Integrating human rights into new and existing policies;
2.	E ngaging with stakeholders on a wide range of human rights issues;
3.	T raining and building the capacity of employees to understand and uphold human rights;
4.	 Evaluating risk assessments across its activities;
5.	A ssessing human rights impacts in high-risk operations;
6.	C oordinating human rights activities through the Nestlé Human Rights Working Group;
7.	Partnering with leading organisations to implement its human rights activities; and
8. Monitoring and reporting on its performance.

For more detail on our Human Rights Due Diligence Programme including our progress across the eight pillars, read our integrated human rights report in our global Nestlé in Society: Creating Shared Value report.
In addition to the work that we have done at the policy level (see Policy section of this report) since 2011, we have also integrated relevant human rights requirements and indicators within existing monitoring mechanisms. This has helped us scale-up our approach to human rights due diligence beyond high-risk countries and monitor our human rights performance in all countries where we operate in a systematic and ongoing manner.
Monitoring our performance We are fully committed to ensuring that our products are not associated with forced labour through our mandatory Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé Supplier Code and Responsible Sourcing Guideline, which requires all of our employees and suppliers, including contractors, to respect human rights and to comply with all applicable labour laws. We monitor compliance both across our business operations and supply chains using the following monitoring mechanisms:

Within our business operations: The CARE Audit Programme Compliance regarding human rights and labour practices, business integrity, safety and health, environmental sustainability and security is assessed through our global CARE programme, which relies on an independent external audit network.
• All sites owned or operated by Nestlé are audited on a three-year auditing cycle which follows an annual action plan discussed and approved by our Group Compliance Committee;
• Any gaps are addressed through detailed action plans and implementation is monitored closely; and
• The programme is led by a Market CARE Coordinator who is responsible for ensuring that audits are performed in a timely fashion, action plans are implemented and all information is uploaded in SAP.
The audits, which take place every three years, are performed by three leading independent audit companies: SGS, Bureau Veritas, and Intertek. Where necessary, we introduce detailed action plans that are thoroughly and systematically monitored.

The findings are classified in three categories:
• Minor – an isolated and non-repetitive finding or minor issue;
• Major – a systematic finding or major issue or infringement against local legislation; and
• Critical – an exceptional issue, which requires immediate notification to the Nestlé Group Compliance Committee.

In 2015, we carried out 250 CARE audits across Nestlé globally, taking our cumulative total to 2,207 audits since 2005.

Speak Up!
The Nestlé Integrity Reporting System (known internally as Speak Up!) enables our employees to report anonymously, via phone or web form, any illegal or non-compliant behaviour they observe, as well as to seek advice or information on our practices.
In 2016, we launched a new awareness campaign to promote Speak Up! across our businesses in the UK.
Our external whistleblowing channel, Tell us, is designed to give all external stakeholders the opportunity to report any possible internal and external non-compliance incidents against the Nestlé Corporate Business. This system helps us achieve our commitment to ensure that all employees and stakeholders can easily report possible compliance violations.
Although Tell Us is run by Nestlé, it is controlled by an independent, external body and allows stakeholders to report non-compliances confidentially or to seek advice on our practices. We have communicated the availability of this tool to 5,000 global suppliers and to more than 1,000 of our downstream business partners, namely our distributors. Going forward, we will continue this roll-out across our value chain and reinforce awareness of the existence of confidential reporting lines across the organisation.

By the end of 2015, we had identified 184 CARE gaps, most of them minor. We have introduced corrective action plans to cover them and to date, 36 have been addressed. The remaining corrective action plans are in the process of being implemented.

In the UK, and in accordance with our audit cycle, no audits were undertaken in 2015. However, six audits will be completed by the end of 2016, including one in Ireland.

Within our supply chains: Responsible Sourcing Programme As the largest food manufacturer in the world, we depend on the timely sourcing of the ingredients we need to make our products. For Nestlé, it makes business sense to look after these supply chains, in order to secure supply in the future. On top of this, we have a duty to ensure that our business and the organisations in our supply chain uphold responsible sourcing practices. This includes ensuring that all rights holders in our supply chain are able to fully exercise their human rights.

Nestlé’s Responsible Sourcing activities work across three strands:
• Farmer Connect: farmers and co-operatives from whom we buy materials directly;
• Tier 1 suppliers: suppliers with whom we deal directly; and
• Sub-tier suppliers: who supply our suppliers and from whom we do not buy directly.
The Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Guideline sets out the acceptable means of verification and what constitutes the definition of ‘Responsibly Sourced’. Our Responsible Sourcing activities define ingredients against these two benchmarks:
• Responsibly Sourced: where places of origin are assessed against our RSG requirements and found to be compliant, or corrective action plans are developed (or equivalent standards implemented); and
• Traceable: where ingredients we buy are identified back to their places of origin, such as mill, plantation or farm.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Report 2016 – Nestlé in the UK

13 23

Responsible Sourcing Audit Programme Nestlé’s auditing of Tier 1 suppliers began in 2010. The purpose of the audits is to verify how a material or service is produced and to drive our direct suppliers’ continuous progress towards full compliance with our Supplier Code, which includes a specific section on human rights and forced labour in particular. All new suppliers are screened when entering into a business relationship with Nestlé, and signing the code is an integral part of our mandatory vendor approval process.

From the end of 2015, we moved away from measuring the number of audits we conducted to measuring the percentage of supply volume and spend. This way we can focus more on higher volume suppliers and more accurately measure and monitor compliance with our Nestlé Supplier Code and responsible sourcing practices.

By 2015, we had achieved our global objective of 10,000 audits with at least 70% full compliance. This means that in 70% of all supplier audits conducted, no non-compliances were identified. Together, the audited suppliers account for some 95% of our overall spend. Our objective for 2016 is that for all Tier 1 suppliers, we cover 50% of the total volume sourced from Responsible Sourcing Guideline audited Tier 1 suppliers, with 70% compliance.

All Tier 1 suppliers with manufacturing locations are audited using the SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) methodology, used widely across the industry. The audit protocol itself follows a comprehensive 4 Pillar audit approach, focusing on the areas of Labour Standards, Health & Safety, Environment, and Business Practices. For all other Tier 1 suppliers with no manufacturing locations, we require all suppliers over a certain size to complete self-assessments using the EcoVadis online assessment platform, and encourage all others to voluntarily complete these assessments. Our ambition is to have all suppliers engaged in this programme in the future.

Whilst we are encouraged to have such strong rates of compliance, our responsible sourcing audits do from time to time uncover incidents of forced labour and modern slavery in our supply chain. All incidents of forced labour or modern slavery are managed on a case by case basis, and we work hard to ensure effective remediation is sought for all rights-holders impacted.

Traceability and assessments The second component of our Responsible Sourcing activities is traceability and assessments. This involves mapping our supply chains back to the primary producer to identify where the material originally comes from. It is a major undertaking, especially with certain ingredients, such as meat and seafood, which have very complex supply chains that may lack transparency. Traceability and transparency are, therefore, essential in enabling us to assess whether our sub-tier suppliers, with whom we do not have a direct commercial relationship, are meeting our ethical and sustainability requirements.

On completion of the audit process, each supplier receives a report detailing areas for improvement and the requirements to achieve compliance. In all cases of non-compliance, a corrective action plan is approved, containing detailed measures and timelines to ensure that practices are improved.
In the UK, we are currently working with 106 First Milk farmers in Cumbria and Ayrshire to enhance responsible farming practices. In 2015 10 of our farmers were assessed against our Responsible Sourcing Guideline, which incorporates input from World Animal Protection. We identified seven gaps against the Responsible Sourcing Guidelines and have subsequently implemented corrective actions for all of them, including further training for all our farmers. The gaps identified related to environmental management and animal welfare. No gaps relating to human rights and specifically modern slavery were identified. Our intention is to carry out another set of assessments in 2018, in accordance with our audit cycle.

Because of the scale of our global operations and the vast size of our supply chains, our responsible sourcing activities continue to focus on 12 priority categories: palm oil, soya, sugar, pulp and paper, coffee, cocoa, dairy, fish and seafood, cereals, vanilla, hazelnuts, and meat, poultry and eggs.
By working directly with different partners for different purposes we are able to ensure that we develop specific and meaningful action plans to address the most salient issues, such as our work with the Fair Labor Association (FLA) in our hazelnut supply chain in Turkey.
Whilst most suppliers to Nestlé UK are managed ‘above the market’, meaning at a regional or global level, where we have suppliers managed directly within the market, we focus our domestic responsible sourcing activities on dairy, sugar, cereals, and meat, poultry and eggs, with our pilot supply chain engagement activity taking place in our dairy supply chain. We are currently working with the 106 First Milk farmers in Cumbria and Ayrshire who supply us with fresh milk to enhance responsible farming practices.

Addressing child labour in our hazelnut supply chain

Turkey is the world’s leading producer of hazelnuts, with around 75% of the total global production. Nestlé mainly purchases hazelnuts as a raw material from the eastern and western parts of the Black Sea region of Turkey; of the 7,000 tonnes we sourced in 2015, more than 4,000 tonnes came from these areas. Even when we do not source directly from the farms but from a small number of suppliers, who obtain the hazelnuts through a chain of intermediaries, we believe that our supply chains represent one of the biggest opportunities at hand to contribute to healthy lives, in a healthy environment and in healthy communities.
Hazelnut harvests are seasonal, requiring large groups of migrant workers and their families to move to the areas in which hazelnut gardens are located for the relatively brief harvest period. Younger members of these families can sometimes become involved in work related to the harvest.
We have been working with the Fair Labor Association (FLA) in Turkey to improve supply chain transparency and implement a monitoring and remediation system for tackling labour and human rights issues. Our action plan focuses on the integration of FLA recommendations and sound labour practices into our sourcing strategy.

As part of our action plan, we are committed to:
• Strengthening child labour monitoring and remediation;
• Continuing to work with local authorities and the ILO to raise awareness through campaigns, training and an illustrated supplier code in Turkish;
• Establishing a toll-free phone number for non-compliance reporting; and
• Introducing a self-assessment tool for hazelnut growers to verify their performance with respect to child labour criteria.
Addressing challenges around labour conditions is complex and requires the collaboration of many stakeholders. This is why multi-stakeholder dialogue and engagement is essential.
We are committed to continuing to take firm steps to make continous progress in the areas that require further work.

All Nestlé suppliers are required to meet our requirements. However, we recognise that supply chain transformation cannot be achieved overnight so, where appropriate, we support suppliers who are not able to meet the RSG immediately but are committed to eliminating non-compliances over time. Progress against these action plans is monitored and regularly reported.

By the end of 2015, 54% of the total volume of the 12 priority categories was traceable (against a global target of 40%). Of this traceable volume, 43% was responsibly sourced (against a global target of 30%). Our target for 2016 is to achieve 50% of the volume of our 12 priority categories to be traceable.

Inevitably, some categories of raw material are making faster progress than others. For example, around 95% of the vanilla flavours we procure are traceable, while for other categories, such as meat, poultry and eggs, and fish and seafood, supply chains are more complex and progress will consequently be slower. However, we are confident that our ongoing activities will enable us to make further progress in improving traceability in 2016, and have introduced a new objective to measure progress.

Beyond Compliance
Globally, Nestlé works with hundreds of thousands of farmers who provide us with the raw agricultural ingredients we use to make our products. Because farmers play such an important role in our supply chain, we developed a programme designed to support the development of local farmers and rural communities, known as Farmer Connect.
Farmer Connect is a flagship Nestlé programme committed to the local sourcing of raw materials, by purchasing goods directly from farmers, co-operatives or selected, trusted trade partners. Through Farmer Connect we engage with approximately 760,000 farmers – mostly smallholders in developing countries.
Farmers and farm workers
We believe that it is important to focus not only on farmers, but also on the farm workers who provide the permanent and casual labour, primarily at harvesting season, though often throughout the year on larger farms. Farm workers are often migrant labour who are frequently ‘invisible’ to traditional support programmes.
We have a responsibility to ensure that farm workers and others employed in our supply chains work in fair labour conditions that meet the terms of our Supplier Code.
Our Rural Development Framework pays particular attention to vulnerable worker groups, especially seasonal, migrant, women and non-family workers. We seek to improve conditions of employment and work and to eradicate forced labour, and we support non-discrimination and freedom of association.

Implementing initiatives such as the UN Global Compact and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO’s) Conventions and recommendations works best when farmers and their workers understand the value of improved conditions and its effect on productivity. Our aim is that our field support staff will, by sharing knowledge and information, be able to provide education and training on issues such as human rights, labour rights, living wages, and health and safety, as well as building capacity and fostering opportunities for dialogue between workers and their representatives.
Through the Nestlé Commitment on Child Labour in Agricultural Supply Chains, we are focusing on the supply chains of cocoa, vanilla and hazelnuts. See the Human rights and compliance section of our global Nestlé in Society: Creating Shared Value report for more information on our commitment to eliminate child labour.
In the UK, we currently work closely with our dairy farmers in Ayrshire and Cumbria whose milk goes into products such as KITKAT and NESCAFÉ Café Menu. Alongside undertaking independent responsible sourcing assessments of these farmers, which you can read more about in the Responsible Sourcing Programme section of this report, we are developing a programme to support development in areas including environmental management, as part of our ongoing Working with Nature initiatives. You can read more about this here.
Through Farmer Connect and the Nestlé Rural Development Framework, we are able to positively contribute to the development of farmers, farm workers and rural communities. By doing so, we aim to mitigate a number of the societal issues facing these groups, and help to support them in being able to fully enjoy their fundamental rights.

Nestlé Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation System in Côte d’Ivoire

Child labour in our cocoa supply chain is a complex issue and gathering reliable evidence about attitudes and perceptions, as well as what is happening on the ground, is vital, but challenging.
In 2015, we continued to implement our action plans to focus specifically on commodities and countries where there is a higher risk of child labour issues, including our cocoa supply chain.
Working with the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI), we created a Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation System (CLMRS) to operate in the Nestlé Cocoa Plan supply chain in Côte d’Ivoire, where we currently work with 79 co-operatives. The CLMRS covers awareness raising in local communities, data gathering about the circumstances of children in our supply chain, and providing cocoa farmers with the practical support and means to get their children back into school. It complements other aspects of the Nestlé Cocoa Plan, which are designed to increase farmer productivity and income and so help them out of poverty.
In 2015, the CLMRS was extended to a further 18 co-operatives, taking the total to 40, and will cover all 79 co-operatives by 2016.
The CLMRS would not function properly without the support provided by the ICI and the FLA, both of which play complementary roles as part of the system. ICI is involved in work at a ground level, and has increased staff members to extend the roll-out of the system by:
• Recruiting Community Liaison People (CLP) and Child Labour Agents;
• Designing, collating and coordinating the child labour database;

• Training all the different actors of the system on child labour but also on their role as part of the system;
• Conducting awareness-raising sessions on child labour for farmers and local communities;
• Designing and implementing remediation activities; and
• Collecting key performance indicators (KPIs) for the purpose of reporting on the overall performance of the system.
The Fair Labor Association (FLA) plays an auditing role, assisting Nestlé in ensuring it becomes progressively compliant with its own Code of Conduct. Each year, the FLA organises its own external audits, selecting co-operatives at random and sending auditors to them to ensure that we meet the FLA Code of Conduct, as well as the Nestlé action plan. Following each assessment, the FLA publishes the results along with our response to each finding and any corrective actions taken. In 2015, the FLA conducted five such audits at six co-operatives in Côte d’Ivoire that supply us with cocoa via the Nestlé Cocoa Plan.
Through our work with the ICI and the FLA, we have gained a better understanding of the issue of child labour. New data and insights enable us to further strengthen our efforts. We are determined to eradicate the problem of child labour in our supply chain and we have made this a priority for our company with actions such as our CLMRS.
We also recognise that the elimination of child labour is a shared responsibility and we are engaging with other global and local stakeholders, including the Ivorian government to make sustained progress in tackling this serious and complex issue.

Performance indicators

Monitoring is key to verifying whether our human rights activities (policies, training, action plans, etc.) have been effectively integrated across the different levels of the company and into our business activities.
All our major monitoring mechanisms now include relevant indicators that help us make our human rights monitoring broader, more systematic and continual.
We are reliant on working closer with our partners and independent experts to both undertake effective monitoring of our activities, as well as to help us in identifying and developing appropriate performance indicators and remedial measures. You can read more about our partners on pages 110 – 111 of our global Nestlé in Society: Creating Shared Value report.
Such performance indicators are framed by the global commitments we have set in relation to both human rights and responsible sourcing. You can read more about these commitments and our performance against them here.

In addition to our global commitments, we have commodity-specific projects with corresponding key performance indicators (KPIs). These projects have been established to specifically address issues which have been identified for particular commodities, such as the identification of forced labour in our Thai fish and seafood supply chain.
We integrate human rights indicators into our management systems to monitor our progress and report on it annually, through our global Nestlé in Society: Creating Shared Value report.
In order to verify our performance and make sure that we are on the right track, we also undertake regular external stakeholder engagement and consultation with independent experts that help inform our understanding and approaches to managing human rights.

At the industry level, we engage with different business organisations – such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) and the UN Global Compact (UNGC) – to advance the business and human agenda in a pre-competitive manner, and invite more companies to join. In January 2016, the CGF Board approved its first resolution on social sustainability specifically addressing the issue of forced labour. We are also an active member of several multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as the ILO Child Labour Platform.
In the UK, Nestlé is a member of the UN Global Compact network’s Modern Slavery Working Group, in which member companies come together to share learning and best practice in the development of corporate human rights approaches, with particular focus on modern slavery.

Human rights have been systematically integrated as part of our annual stakeholder convenings, which gather representatives from government agencies, international organisations, trade unions, business associations, civil society organisations and academia. In addition to these convenings, we engage with key local stakeholders as part of our in-country Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs). The combination of global and local expert inputs offers us a unique opportunity to incorporate new ideas and perspectives into our overall approach to human rights.

Tackling labour abuses in the seafood supply chain
Our mandatory Nestlé Supplier Code and Responsible Sourcing Guidelines (RSG) on Fish and Seafood require all of our suppliers to respect human rights and to comply with all applicable labour laws. To reinforce this, Nestlé is taking action to eliminate labour and human rights abuses in the seafood supply chain. In 2015, we commissioned Verité, an NGO that works with companies to help understand and tackle labour issues, to investigate allegations of abuses in the Thai fishing industry. They collected information from fishing vessels, ports, mills and farms in Thailand on a range of issues, including trafficking, forced and underage labour, lack of grievance procedures, workplace conditions, and wages and benefits.
Following Verité’s investigation we have launched an action plan on seafood sourced from Thailand, which takes into account their recommendations. Focused on 10 key activities, the plan contains a series of actions, designed to protect workers from abuses, improve working conditions and tackle unacceptable practices, including juvenile and teenage working. Those actions include establishing a migrant workforce emergency response team, setting up a grievance mechanism, providing training for captains and boat owners operating in the industry, raising awareness about minimum required labour standards, establishing better traceability of raw materials and enabling verification of labour standards in fishing vessels.
The action plan was published in November 2015 and immediately put into place. It has been rolled-out throughout 2016, with a dedicated manager being based in Thailand to oversee its implementation. Alongside the Thai Government, local seafood suppliers and international buyers, we also continue to participate in the multi-stakeholder ILO Working Group, which is seeking collaborative solutions to improve labour conditions in Thailand’s complex seafood export industry.

Training Our human rights training is delivered at two different levels. At the global level, we have developed an online human rights training module for Nestlé employees which is currently in the process of being rolled-out. The objectives of these modules are to:
• Make all employees aware of the company’s position regarding human rights and inform them about the relevant Nestlé policies and procedures;
• Share with them good practice examples based on our experience in this area; and
• Make them think – individually and collectively – about human rights issues, challenges and opportunities in their own work environment.
At the functional level, we have developed specific training modules for targeted departments with the company. These aim to go one step further than the online training, as they focus on issues that are specific to the function, using real-life case studies or imagined scenarios.
Since 2011, we have trained 72,778 employees on human rights across 66 countries. In 2015, we trained 8,130 (2.4%) employees on human rights across nine FTSE4Good Countries of Concern, where there is greater potential for exposure to human rights risk. (The FTSE4Good is the ethical stock market indices of the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, and is designed to measure objectively the performance of companies that meet globally recognised corporate responsibility standards.) Other countries, including the UK, are receiving this training over the course of 2016 and 2017.

What’s next?

As part of our approach to Creating Shared Value, we set ourselves 39 global corporate commitments to be achieved by 2020.
Our commitments reflect the material issues of our business and help shape our strategy for continuous improvement. Of these commitments, a number are explicitly linked to improving the way in which we and our stakeholders, including our upstream supply chain, respect human rights.
1. Assess and address human rights impacts in our operations and supply chain We are determined to manage our salient human rights issues – those human rights at risk of the most severe negative impacts through the company’s activities and business relationship, including forced labour. We plan on achieving this through our human rights due diligence programme and putting in place dedicated action plans for each issue identified as salient, which we have committed to doing by the end of 2016.
We have also committed to undertaking six additional human rights impact assessments in countries where we have significant business operations, by the end of 2018.
2. Eliminate child labour in key commodities In addition to continuing to strengthen our existing programmes and approaches focused on eliminating child labour in the supply chain, we have committed

to undertaking child labour risk assessments for all 12 high-priority categories of raw ingredients and deploy responsible sourcing strategies to monitor and mitigate occurrences of child labour. We aim to complete these risk assessments by the end of 2018.
3. Implement responsible sourcing in our supply chain Mapping our extended supply chains across priority categories of ingredients and materials is a long-term process. Working together with specialist partners and other agencies, we’re making steady progress but as each supply chain presents its own set of challenges, we also need to define, develop and implement strategies to address such complex issues as women’s empowerment and deforestation. Our progress towards having traceable and Responsibly Sourced raw materials in each of our 12 priority categories is summarised on page 112 of our global Nestlé in Society: Creating Shared Value report. We will continue to report on our progress across these categories on an annual basis.
In the specific categories of coffee and cocoa, we have separate commitments which seek to continuously improve our green coffee supply chain and continue to roll-out the Nestlé Cocoa Plan with cocoa farmers.
4. Ensure that all employees and stakeholders can easily report possible compliance violations Transparency is vital if we are going to be effective in ensuring that all rights holders are able to enjoy the human rights they possess. This is why we have committed to scaling-up our communications and awareness raising of both internal and external independent whistleblowing mechanisms. We have committed that by the end of 2016 we will have

reinforced awareness of the existence of confidential reporting lines across the business, and will continue to scale-up communication about ‘Tell us’ to suppliers and downstream business partners as well as to second-phase countries (an additional 20 countries).

5. Roll-out the Rural Development Framework to understand the needs of farmers We recognise that in our upstream supply chain some human rights issues, such as child labour and forced labour, can be linked to a range of other influencing factors including women’s empowerment and the position of farm workers, which is why we are committed to continuing the roll-out of our Rural Development Framework. By doing so, we hope to be better able to understand the needs of our farmers and farm workers, and work better together to address human rights issues including forced labour and human trafficking.

We have identified eight core areas that we believe are important elements of successful rural development. By focusing on these issues and using our expertise, either directly or through our partners, we aim to make a real impact on the livelihoods of farmers within our supply chains.

The eight core areas are:

• Farm economics;

• Water and sanitation;

• Nutrition;

• Farmer knowledge and skills;

• Farm workers;

• Women’s empowerment; and

• Land and land tenure; • Natural resource stewardship.

The road ahead

Whilst Nestlé UK is a relatively small part of the company’s global value chain, we continue to play an active role in meeting the global commitments we have set ourselves as a Group.

We know that there is a lot of work to be done, and we plan on strengthening the existing training and capacity building we have in place for our UK-based employees across our businesses, to include a specific e-learn module on modern slavery and the UK Modern Slavery Act legislation.
We will also expand the information we provide to our suppliers and contractors across the UK to include explicit reference to compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act. This will feed into revised supplier assessment criteria, including the supplier review process, which forms an important element of our comprehensive supplier responsible sourcing programme.
In our domestic upstream supply chains, starting with our dairy supply chain, we are working with the First Milk dairy farmers we work with to undertake responsible sourcing audits. Following successful completion of this supply chain pilot, we hope to continue the roll-out of these audits across other domestic category supply chains, including cereals, and meat, poultry and eggs.

We are determined to continue to embed responsible and effective management of all human rights issues including modern slavery and human trafficking. Going forward, the responsibility for overseeing operational performance in relation to the UK Modern Slavery Act will sit with the market-wide Nestlé Ethics & Compliance Committee, chaired by our Group Legal Director. We believe that this internal governance structure will enable oversight, accountability and transparency at all levels of our business. We are committed to reporting regularly and transparently on our performance as Nestlé in the UK and look forward to providing an update on our progress in this area in our 2017 report.
Ultimately, upholding ethical principles in our business and supply chain is fundamental to who we are as a responsible business and underpins our license to operate. We see our responsibility to respect human rights across our supply chain as critical to our success and as the right thing to do.
On behalf of Nestlé UK

We will carry on with our ongoing comprehensive mapping of our supply chains in the UK. We have started this mapping across our upstream supply chain, initially focused on direct supply. This will be followed by building a more comprehensive picture of our indirect supplying activities, including co-manufactured and imported products. Due to the complex nature of our value chains, this latter step will take time but we intend on reporting back through this report with an annual update on progress.

Rygor Slavery And Human Trafficking Statement

The Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA 2015) focuses specifically on the issue of modern slavery to ensure offenders are suitably reprimanded with severe sentences. Modern slavery encompasses the offences of: ‘slavery’ where ownership is exercised over a person; ‘servitude’ which involves the obligation to provide service imposed by coercion; ‘forced or compulsory labour’ involves work or service exacted from any person under the menace of a penalty and for which the person has not offered themselves voluntarily; and ‘human trafficking’ concerns arranging or facilitating the travel of another with a view to exploiting them.
This statement therefore explains the steps we have taken during the 2017/2018 financial year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any of our supply chains or any part of our business.
Rygor is a nationwide business operating as a Mercedes-Benz Commercial vehicle dealership who have various branches and maintenance sites across the UK. Rygor are reliant on supply chains and recognise that steps needed to be put in place to reduce the risk of human trafficking, forced labour/debt bondage, sexual exploitation, criminal exploitation and domestic servitude. We have internal policies in place, which are available to all staff, these can also be accessed by third parties on request, simply contact Human Resources for a copy. Our policies are reviewed annually by Rygor Human Resources department and legal advisers to ensure we remain compliant. As part of the Rygor induction process and throughout workers’ employment with us, we train all staff to treat others with respect and courtesy as well as ensuring they adhere to all relevant laws, regulations and standards. The Modern Slavery Act is a prominent policy identified within the Rygor Induction day and remains an ongoing due diligence process. The policy also forms part of our contractors permit to work. We focus on ensuring our management team is not only aware of the requirements and to be alert to modern slavery but can also address concerns raised by their team or any suppliers. If any worker is found in breach of our policies, we ensure suitable disciplinary action is taken which can include termination. In relation to our supply chains, we use our reasonable endeavours to conduct risk assessments of the third parties we work with and investigate, where feasible, the working conditions of their workers. Rygor require our supply chains to read our statement and contractor principles and sign the declaration. Our statement and processes are relayed in any tendering business we may be applying for.
We also ensure that Rygor supply chains are mindful of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and comply with our standards, avoiding any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy and to take action if informed of any non-compliance with this policy whilst treating all workers with dignity and respect
We allow all individuals who work or provide services to us the right to freely choose employment and, the right to associate freely with other individuals. Workers are free to choose whether to join a trade union or not and as a result of our training, we offer an environment which is free from harassment and unlawful discrimination. We ensure our working practices are in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 and all employment legislation.
We do not engage in forced or involuntary labour and have a zero tolerance approach to the same, meaning we do not tolerate any of our suppliers engaging in such conduct. We require suppliers to certify that they do not participate in any forced or involuntary labour with their workers, subcontractors, agents or associates. We aim to ensure that our performance indicators do not put pressure on or influence any modern slavery risk.
As a result of our risk assessments, we have introduced additional company information about modern slavery to the Rygor Induction day, adding the policy to Health and Safety contractor and sub-contractor packs and introducing the MSA 2015 policy to first day paperwork for all staff across Rygor. Rygor have improved whistleblowing procedures which outlines clear procedures for reporting concerns outlined in the MSA 2015 and progress against reducing such risk.

Introduction
Koch Ag & Energy Solutions, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “KAES”) are committed to conducting all affairs lawfully and with integrity. This commitment extends throughout our global organizations, no matter where we do business. Relationships with persons or entities who provide goods or services to KAES or who are authorized to conduct business for or on our behalf (collectively, “Third Parties”) who demonstrate they share this commitment are a key part of KAES’s continued success.
Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“Act”) requires companies with an annual turnover in excess of £36m to issue a statement about steps taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not occurring. The following information is provided pursuant to the Act.
Organization’s Structure
KAES is a global provider of value-added solutions for the agriculture, turf and ornamental, energy and chemical markets. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc.
KAES is one of the world's largest producers and marketers of fertilizers. These companies own or have interests in fertilizer plants in the U.S., Canada, and Trinidad and Tobago and a distribution network covering global demand through state-of-the-art terminals in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and Australia.
Our Supply Chains
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we have processes in place to vet our employees as well as Third Parties prior to them engaging in any business activities. Individuals that work for KAES go through various screening processes based on what their role will be at KAES. Direct employees of KAES are employed under the Employment-At-Will Policy and as such, may be terminated at any time where not prohibited by law or separate contract of employment. KAES maintains a guideline service that allows anyone, including Third Parties, to report concerns anonymously at any time.
We perform internal checks and have contracted with outside services to monitor our business relationships with Third Parties to avoid dealings with individuals or businesses that do not align with our values. All Third Parties go through various screening processes based on the perceived risk of the interaction. KAES maintains a Third Party vetting program which describes the process for selecting Third Parties in alignment with KAES’s risk philosophy, including but not limited to preventing transactions with Third Parties that are in violation of the law. Part of the program focuses on enhanced vetting for Third Parties in high risk jurisdictions. Our suppliers, distributors, and agents may conduct business in locations that are known to have elevated risks. There is no widely known risk of

Supplier Adherence to Our Values
We expect all those in our supply chain to comply with our values. We maintain standard Terms and Conditions that require counterparties to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations. This statement is made and reflects the position of KAES as of 07/25/2018.

47,"JD WETHERSPOON ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT 2016 / 2017
Introduction from John Hutson – Chief Executive Officer
JD Wetherspoon Plc is committed to taking all necessary steps to ensure that our company policies and working practices help combat the global issues of slavery and human trafficking.
We have updated our company policies and procedures to specifically address these issues and have bolstered our current systems to reinforce our zero-tolerance company stance against modern day slavery and human trafficking.
In the past year, we have informed our suppliers of our expectations of them to monitor their supply chains. We have delivered training to employees at our head office and pubs so they can identify and report suspected cases of slavery and human trafficking.
John Hutson
Organisation's structure
JD Wetherspoon Plc is an operator of managed public houses and hotels in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with headquarters situated in Watford, Hertfordshire, England. As at August 2017, we had approximately 37,000 employees and 895 pubs, including 53 hotels. The company has an annual turnover of approximately £1.6 billion.
Our supply chain
JD Wetherspoon Plc’s supply chain includes approximately 200 food, drink and non-consumable suppliers and 400 property suppliers. We also source products from a number of micro-breweries and local suppliers. Whilst a substantial proportion of our suppliers are based in the UK and Ireland, we also have a range of suppliers from around the world, who vary considerably both in terms of size and our annual spend with them.
Our new suppliers are subject to a stringent internal approvals process and are required to adhere to our Supplier Charter and the Responsible Supplier Principles contained in it before they are permitted to work with us.
Many of our suppliers hold international quality standards and accreditations and are regularly audited by the issuing authorities to ensure adherence to these requirements. We also audit a selection of our suppliers to check compliance with our company’s quality standards. Our suppliers all conform to accredited assurance schemes that are relevant to their geographical location and product supplied. These assurance schemes must also comply with all EU legislation.
In addition, we have numerous other service providers and property contractors who are subject to an initial due-diligence process managed by a third party, Acoura, on our behalf. We have issued our Responsible Supplier Principles to our suppliers as a step to ensure compliance with these requirements in all areas of our organisation.
October 2017

JD WETHERSPOON ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT 2016 / 2017
This year we joined Sedex, a collaborative platform for sharing responsible sourcing data on supply chains. This will enable us to manage our suppliers’ performance and monitor our supply chains more closely. Over the next twelve months we will start to map out our supply chain starting with food and drink suppliers before moving on to the providers of non-consumable items and services.
Having undertaken an extensive review of our supply chain, we have selected direct-to-pub suppliers as an area of focus for this financial year. We have written to these suppliers to advise of our requirements and expectations and conducted audit activity to check compliance.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Supplier Charter and Responsible Supplier Principles reflect our commitment to conducting business ethically and with integrity with effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our business.
When compiling the Responsible Supplier Principles we made extensive reference to the UN International Labour Convention codes of practice, the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code, the Global Social Compliance Programme Reference Code and the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
As part of sourcing products from many different countries, it would be impossible for JD Wetherspoon to monitor all elements of our suppliers’ supply chains or every individual who is involved with sourcing our products. We therefore set agreed standards with our suppliers and expect suppliers to conform within their own operations. These minimum standards apply to all our suppliers across all countries and different jurisdictions where our products are sourced from. We expect our suppliers to be fully responsible for implementing these principles and accountable for any non-compliance.
The Responsible Supplier Principles must be applied at all times and, whilst we will work with suppliers to assist with compliance, if required changes are not made, we will impose strict sanctions on any supplier which refuses to comply with these standards and principles and may ultimately cease to trade with that supplier.
Supplier adherence to our Responsible Supplier Principles
To ensure all suppliers and contractors comply with our values and ethics we have in place a robust supply chain compliance programme. This consists of:
 Maintaining a risk register to identify and rank commercial suppliers in terms of risk;  Conducting audits on a 12 – 18 month rotation, including detailed walk-arounds of suppliers’
premises and welfare facilities (where applicable);  Reviewing suppliers’ policy statements on ethical matters including slavery and human trafficking;  Speaking to staff employed by suppliers to investigate working practices;  Developing action plans to deal with suppliers who have not responded to our request to adhere
to the Supplier Charter.
We have a cross-functional compliance team which consists of senior personnel from the following departments: Legal, Commercial, Audit and Personnel.
October 2017

JD WETHERSPOON ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT 2016 / 2017
Training This year we developed and delivered Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking awareness training to all of our employees at our head office and those performing a management role in our pubs. We will continue to review the training annually. We also delivered specific training to our purchasing and audit teams and those whose roles are directly involved with our supply chain. Training will continue to be reviewed on an annual basis. Further steps We will periodically review the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains. This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 30 July 2017. ……………………………………………………………………………………….

MODERN SLAVERY ACT TRANSPARENCY STATEMENT
This statement is made to section 54(1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. The purpose of the
Modern Slavery Act is to prevent modern slavery in a company's organization and its supply chain.
August Storck KG (Storck) and its subsidiary companies as Storck UK Ltd. fully support the goals of
the Modern Slavery Act.
Storck successfully produces chocolate specialties and quality sugar confectionery under some of
the best-loved sweets brands like Werther's Original, merci and Toffifee. Starting as a candy manu-
facturer in 1903, the company is still a private, owner-managed family business and is among the 10
largest confectionery manufacturers worldwide. Our sweets are produced at our productions sites in
Germany from where they are shipped to all international markets. More than 100 countries around
the world are supplied with our unique brands and products.
Storck confirms its strong determination to contribute to the elimination of all forms of slavery or hu-
man trafficking. It supports the protection of human rights and advances respect for human rights in
its supply chains. Storck is certified according to the internationally accredited social standard Social
Accountability 8000 (SA8000).
SA8000 is a standard, which was founded by non-profit organization ""SAI"" (Social Accountability
International). A company that is audited and certified according to SA8000 documents a socially
responsible management system accounting for the rights of employees, their working conditions
and elementary human rights in the business operations of a company. Therefore, in the standard
SA8000, particular emphasis is placed on issues such as child labour, slavery, health and safety,
freedom of association, discrimination, disciplining, working hours, salary and a management system
to ensure the compliance with these aspects. If you are interested to find out more about this stand-
ard, please refer to http://www.sa-intl.org/.
Storck has established a social code of conduct which is based on the aforementioned aspects of
the SA8000 standard and applies internationally to all subsidiaries. All our employees are regularly
trained to be familiar with the social standard in order to identify and remedy modern slavery. Storck
takes care that its suppliers throughout the entire supply chain are in compliance with the principles
of the standard SA8000.

modern slavery act 2015
Victoria PLC (“Victoria” or the “Group”) is taking steps to ensure that slavery or human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chain.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) and constitutes the slavery and trafficking statement for Victoria and its subsidiaries.
Our Structure
Victoria is an international manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products, with operations in the UK, Europe and Australia. The Group, which is headquartered in Kidderminster, designs, manufactures and distributes a range of carpet, underlay, hard flooring, artificial grass and flooring accessories.
Victoria’s non-UK subsidiaries are not subject to the Act and are therefore excluded from the ambit of this statement. Nevertheless the Victoria Group in its entirety seeks to be compliant with high standards of integrity and ethical behaviour.
Our Procedures
We have a number of procedures in place that contribute to ensuring modern slavery does not occur in our business or supply chains.
Employment:
Recruitment processes in line with UK employment laws, including ‘right to work’ document checks, contracts of employment, and checks to ensure everyone employed is of legal working age; Market-related pay and reward, which is reviewed annually.
Transparency in our supply chains:
We intend to govern all current and future supplier relationships with the

slavery issues outlined in the Act in mind. We will not knowingly support and/or do business with any suppliers who are involved in slavery or human trafficking. The nature of our businesses means that our supply chain is predominantly limited to the clients that we deal with directly. As such, we have not identified any activities within our business that could have a high risk of slavery or human trafficking. We, therefore, have not identified any specific additional steps that we need to take within our organisation. This statement, which will be reviewed annually as required, has been approved by the board of Victoria on 20 March 2017. For an on behalf of Victoria PLC Geoffrey Wilding Executive Chairman, Victoria PLC 20 March 2017

At John Bean Technologies Corporation (JBT), our vision is to be the premier provider of world-class, mission-critical technology solutions for the food processing and air transportation industries. We can only realize our vision if we conduct business in an ethical manner. JBT has in place a strong code of ethical conduct, which is reflected in the One JBT Guide to Ethical Conduct (Guide to Ethics). We expect our employees and suppliers to adhere to the letter and spirit of the relevant provisions of our Guide to Ethics. Because we have this expectation, we rely upon our suppliers to do what is necessary to eradicate the use of unethical labor practices in their supply chains. Accordingly, JBT does not use a third party to evaluate and address the risk of trafficking and forced labor in its supply chains; JBT does not conduct independent, unannounced audits of its suppliers to evaluate their compliance with our expectations for ethical labor practices; and JBT does not require its suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into our products comply with anti-trafficking and forced labor laws. And, although JBT maintains standards and procedures for ensuring that its employees comply with the Guide to Ethics, JBT does not maintain specific standards and procedures for ensuring that its suppliers and contractors comply with JBT’s expectations for ethical labor practices. Finally, although JBT employees regularly receive training on the Guide to Ethics, JBT does not routinely provide training on trafficking and forced labor issues. This statement is made pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

This statement is published on behalf of Ashurst LLP and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ashurst Business Services Limited, each having a turnover in excess of £36 million and references to ""Ashurst"", ""we"", ""us"", ""our"" or the ""firm"" are to both and to the related entities that carry on the Ashurst business across the world.

Our approach
We are committed to achieving the highest standards of ethical behaviour in the conduct of our business and activities worldwide. We support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and endeavour to make sure that Ashurst is not complicit in human rights abuses. To this end, we will not tolerate slavery or human trafficking or abusive or unfair treatment in any part of our own business or in any of our supply chains. We are generally, and in particular through our policies and practices in relation to procurement, human resources and corporate responsibility, committed to taking steps to ensure that slavery and human trafficking play no part in our own business or in our supply chains.
Policies and procedures that are in place and steps that we have taken are set out below.
Policies
We have a Global Corporate Responsibility Policy which, among other things, sets out our policy and approach on antislavery and human trafficking.
We have formal Global Procurement Policy and Guidelines and a formal Global Contracts Protocol. The Global Procurement Policy and Guidelines aim to ensure that all goods and services acquired on behalf of the firm are acquired in line with procurement best practice, on the most advantageous commercial terms, at the lowest risk profile and with proper consideration of the social, environmental and ethical impacts of such activity.

The Global Contracts Protocol aims to manage the firm's contractual risks by ensuring that appropriate due diligence is undertaken before entering into contracts. Due diligence requirements include a specific requirement to carry out due diligence in relation to slavery and enforced labour with all potential new vendors to Ashurst.
Procurement and supplier due diligence
Existing suppliers. Following on from activities in 2016 and 2017, 2018 saw the firm complete an audit of its key suppliers within the IT supply chain. Following a risk-based analysis, it was determined that there was an inherent risk of modern slavery and enforced labour in IT hardware third party supply chains. Subsequently, a questionnaire was submitted to the firm's key IT vendors requesting information on the processes undertaken by these suppliers to identify and mitigate the risk of modern slavery and enforced labour in their supply chain. The results of the audit were positive with all key IT suppliers reporting strong compliance models including site inspections, quality audits and independent accreditations.
It is the firm's priority to ensure our supplier management approach is continually reviewed. Over the coming year we plan to continue to develop our risk analysis and audit processes in relation to key third party suppliers.
New suppliers. Our standard bid invitation documentation asks due diligence questions of vendors to determine the steps they take to avoid or eliminate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chain. This forms one of the evaluation criteria behind our selection of new vendors.
It is a priority for the firm to ensure our robust selection criteria is implemented during the sourcing of any new supplier to identify potential modern slavery issues. While this has not occurred as yet, the existence of any slavery or human trafficking issue would mean a supplier would be immediately disqualified from the procurement process.
Training of staff involved in procurement
We have provided training for relevant staff who are likely to conduct procurement of goods and/or services for the firm or who manage our supplier relationships, with a view to stressing, amongst other things, Ashurst's zero tolerance stance on slavery and human trafficking as well as to reinforce the policies and procedures that we have in place.
Recruitment and welfare of our people
We are a leading law firm with more than 3,000 employees, partners and contractors working across Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. As a professional services firm, people are our most valuable asset at all levels of the business.
As part of our HR policies and procedures, we only use reputable recruitment firms and comply with all relevant local laws and regulations. We regularly review our global recruitment procedures and providers, as well as our arrangements for employee welfare and care. All employees are paid at least the minimum wage in the local jurisdiction and in London employees and contractors are paid the London Living Wage or above.

52,"Modern Slavery Act: Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
2015/16 Financial Year
Introduction
Corney and Barrow fully supports the United Kingdom’s stance on combatting human trafficking and modern slavery and is pleased to outline the action that we have taken during our 2015/16 financial year to help tackle these abhorrent crimes.
Our business is 230 years old and is one of the longest established Independent Wine Merchants in the UK. The company is privately owned and has grown nationally and internationally with sales offices in London, Edinburgh, North Yorkshire and, more recently, Hong Kong and Singapore. We also run shops in Newmarket and Ayr, having acquired the Scottish Merchants Whighams of Ayr in 1994.
We offer carefully-selected, honestly-priced wines to our customers that not only deliver quality and value for money, but also a sense of place. We want to offer benchmark styles; wines which we believe to be the best examples of a wine style, country, region or sub-region, whether they are wines to drink immediately or wines to lay down. As such, wherever possible we aim to build exclusive relationships with our suppliers, meaning that we develop good knowledge of their operations and business practices, putting us in a strong position to identify malpractice.
Our approach to business is an ethical one and to support this we have developed and published:
 Our 5 Corporate Values: Relationships, Spirit, Excellence, Independence and Integrity
 An Anti-Bribery Policy  A Fraud Policy  A Code of Conduct for Members of Staff incorporating a Whistleblowing Policy  A Sales Code of Conduct
We currently hold two Royal Warrants as suppliers to HM Queen Elizabeth II and HRH The Prince of Wales. We are members of ‘The Bunch’, a group of Britain’s leading independent wine merchants, which champions the causes of both the independent wine trade and individual, ‘grower-made’ wines. Established in 1993, membership is limited to six merchants of which Corney & Barrow is one. This small, select group has created and adheres to its own Code of Practice.
Our structure
During the last financial year to 30 April 2016, Corney & Barrow Group Ltd, a private company, acted as an investment holding company with three trading subsidiaries:
Corney & Barrow Ltd: The principal activity of the Company is that of wine and spirit merchants.

Corney & Barrow Bars Ltd: The principal activity of the Company is the operation of bars.
Corney & Barrow Group Services Ltd: The principal activity of the Company is that of provider of management services and facilities to other Group members.
Since the year end, Cormey & Barrow Bars Ltd has been sold to a third party.
Assessing and Managing Risk
The management of risk within Corney & Barrow falls under the scrutiny of the Audit and Remuneration Committee; modern slavery & human trafficking has therefore appeared as an agenda item for the Committee and will continue to do so in the future. Responsibility for implementing the firm’s activities to counter modern slavery lies with the Group Commercial Director. We are members of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. We support their efforts to encourage member companies to develop relationships with their supply chains so that information about modern slavery and human trafficking risks can be identified and appropriately shared.
Action taken
During the last financial year Corney & Barrow has taken the following action to detect and counter the risks of human trafficking and modern slavery taking place within our supply chain:
 We have developed and published a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking policy.  We have reviewed and rationalised our supplier database, ensuring that the
information that we hold on our suppliers is up to date and verified.  We have registered with HM Revenue & Customs under the Alcohol Wholesale
Registration Scheme, which helps to ensure that the wine that we offer for sale originates from verifiable sources.  We have put in place a comprehensive, risk-based process to undertake due diligence on our supply chain.  We have undertaken a risk assessment on our supply chain with regard to modern slavery and human trafficking in order to identify those suppliers where these are at greatest risk of occurring. To do this we have examined the risks according to the country where our suppliers are based, such as Chile and Argentina, together with the sectors in which our business operates, such as shipping and haulage.  We have prepared awareness information for all our members of staff to enable them to understand what modern slavery is and to know what to do should they suspect that it might be occurring.
Action to be taken over the coming year
 We will be asking entities within our supply chain to tell us what they are doing to combat modern slavery and human trafficking.
 We will be distributing the awareness information to our members of staff, particularly those responsible for developing and maintain relationships with our suppliers, and monitoring the effectiveness of its content.
 We will continue to monitor and evaluate our action to counter modern slavery and human trafficking at Board level (by the Audit and Remuneration Committee).
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for our last financial year.

53,"Modern Slavery
Introduction Calbee, Inc. corporate vision is to be respected, admired and loved by our customers, employees, suppliers, distributors and communities. We believe that we can only earn such respect by taking our corporate social responsibility seriously. This includes ensuring that there is transparency in our business and throughout our supply chains and reporting on the steps we have taken each year to achieve this, for the purposes of section 54 of the
Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act).
Our business Calbee, Inc. is an award winning global business committed to developing a full range of snacks for the global market. We are one of the largest snack companies in the world and have more than 3,700 employees across 12 different countries and understand that as a major employer we have a corporate responsibility to create a positive
social impact.
We conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner. We achieve this by supporting the community and people where we work and live and actively caring for the environment in which we operate.
""Our Business is People Business"" and that is why we consider it essential to have an environment in which every worker can realise their full potential and achieve success, regardless of gender, nationality or race.
UK Calbee (UK) Limited is committed to ensuring the welfare of its employees. Our colleagues and their families are
partners in our business and we committed to being better for everyone.
We comply with all applicable legislation relating to employee terms and conditions, including pay, and none of our staff earn less than the Living Wage.
We are also subject to regular SEDEX ethical audits. These involve a thorough formal examination of our labour practices which enable us to understand, measure, report on and help to improve our social and environmental
performance and we are proud of our consistently strong results in these audits.
Working with our suppliers We expect all of our contractors and suppliers to meet the same high ethical standards that we apply to our own
business and we welcome the opportunities provided by the Act to continue to enhance and strengthen our relationships with our suppliers.
Calbee (UK) Limited has various international suppliers. We work together with our business partners to ensure our entire supply chain always provides safe products with the right quality. Our Quality Review Department regularly conducts reviews of standards and compliance with related laws and our Quality Audit Department regularly conducts audits of our suppliers and provides support to improve quality.
UK The majority of Calbee (UK) Limited’s suppliers are based in the UK, except for rice, one of the minor ingredients for our products, which is sourced from the United States of America. The majority of our suppliers are therefore located in territories where there is a low risk of modern slavery taking place. We will be undertaking a more detailed review
of how we engage with our existing suppliers and our processes for onboarding new suppliers.

Once this review is complete, we will consider any necessary changes to our procurement procedures, including additional supplier due diligence and contractual protections as appropriate, as well as training our staff on the key
points of these.
Corporate responsibility We recognise that our business cannot continue without the support and understanding of the local communities in
which we operate and we wish to make a positive difference to people’s lives. Our corporate social responsibility strategy is based on our three pillars: • support for communities • support for childcare and • support for the environment.
Our policies We already have a number of policies in place, including a procurement policy that sets out our process in relation to
decision making in connection to our suppliers. We adhere to reasonable standards regarding the selection of suppliers based on our supplier guidelines.
We also have in place an anti-bribery policy.
We will review and update these and our other policies as appropriate once we have completed the detailed review of our supplier processes. We may also consider developing a bespoke anti-slavery policy.
Board approval This slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2016 has been approved by, in
accordance with section 54 of the Act.

54,"Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy Statement
This statement is made on behalf of MacIntyre with regards to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 which requires large employers (with turnover of £36million or more) to be transparent about their efforts to eradicate Slavery and Human Trafficking in their supply chain.
We are a provider of health and social care services for those who have learning disabilities. We have been delivering health and social care services throughout the UK for up to 50 years. We provide many care services including registered care, supported living, adult learning centres, outreach, a school and other educational provisions. Our supply chains include the procurement of agency staff and the recruiting of permanent employees. We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business.
Although we have taken no specific actions to actively combat slavery or human trafficking, the recruitment checks that we carry out for each candidate that we are looking to employ, or deal with through our third party agency suppliers, are stringent to ensure that we are able to pick up on any potential issues. We ensure that:
 Each person has a valid Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check from the UK.  The candidate has the Right to Work in the UK, and that the documents provided to us are legitimate.
This includes documents with proof of address. They must also have a bank account in their name to be paid.  (If they have lived overseas in the last 5 years) an Overseas Police Check is requested.  2 References, 1 of which must be verbally verified with the referee.
We ensure that we work to protect whistle-blowers within our organisation, and should any evidence of slavery or human trafficking become apparent to us, we will do all in our power, as is laid out in our whistleblowing policy, to protect whistleblowers and to protect those who may find themselves victims of slavery and/or human trafficking. Our employees are encouraged to identify and report any potential breaches.
Whilst we attempt to ensure that any part of our supply chain runs in accordance with our policies, and through due diligence we attempt to eradicate this to the best of our ability, should any supplier of agency staff be found to be involved with slavery or human trafficking, we will immediately suspend our use of that organisation and provide relevant details to the relevant authorities.

For more information about the reason for this statement and the measures that we will look to incorporate in the future in regards to the Modern Slavery Act 2015, please follow the link below: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transparency-in-supply-chains-a-practical-guide Upon request, our policies on Recruitment and Whistleblowing can be made available. All MacIntyre policies are formally reviewed by Directors every year. For the date of, or evidence of, the most recent review, please contact the Compliance Team.

56,"Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking

The Phoenix Group remains committed to addressing modern slavery, servitude, forced labour; and human trafficking in all its forms and carrying out our business in a fair, honest, ethical and open manner. The Group’s Sourcing and Procurement Policy requires that all resources understand all potential modern slavery and human trafficking risks related to our business and we ensure that we have systems and controls in place to prevent these risks from occurring in our business and/or in our supply chains. In addition, the Group operates a number of employee policies to address the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking within our business.
As required by the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”), this statement describes the steps that the Phoenix Group has taken during the financial year ended 31 December 2018 to prevent modern slavery from taking place in our supply chains and within our own business.

Phoenix Group Structure and Supply Chain Phoenix Group is the largest specialist consolidator of heritage life assurance funds in Europe. Our main focus is on closed life fund consolidation where we specialise in the acquisition and management of closed life insurance and pension funds. We call this our Heritage business.
Alongside this, we have an open business which manufactures and underwrites new products and policies to support people saving for their future in areas such as workplace pensions and SIPPs. This open business is underpinned by a strategic partnership with Standard Life Aberdeen plc following our acquisition of Standard Life Assurance Limited in 2018. We also have a market leading brand - SunLife - which sells a range of financial products specifically for the over 50s market.
In total the Group has over 10 million policyholders and £240 billion of assets and we have operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany. The Group has five operating life companies which hold policyholder assets and a distribution business, SunLife.
The Group operates a highly outsourced operating model and the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain is considered low due to the nature of our business. However, this assessment does not give rise to complacency. The Group’s policies are targeted toward the prevention of modern slavery in our supply chain as well as our own business.
Phoenix Group Policies Our employees continue to be subject to, and benefit from, a wide range of policies including, disciplinary, grievance, nondiscrimination, remuneration and numerous compliance policies. The policies and frameworks that we have in place limit the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in the workplace and encourage all staff to work and act ethically.
Our policies also reflect our commitments to pay employees fairly and properly for their work, act with integrity and ethically in all of our relationships and to corroborate the same level of commitment within our supply base.
Our employees and suppliers are encouraged to speak out should they encounter any wrongdoing, including any concerns in respect of modern slavery. They are further supported by the Group’s Whistleblowing policy which provides a number of channels for concerns to be reported confidentially with appropriate action taken.
Service Provider Due Diligence Our Due Diligence guidelines require that any potential suppliers with an annual turnover in excess of £36M have a published modern slavery statement and policy while those with an annual turnover below £36M provide a copy of their modern slavery policy for review prior to appointment.

These business relationships are then appropriately monitored, proportionally to their potential risk and, in 2018, the practise of conducting additional reviews whenever material changes which may enhance the risk of Modern Slavery are implemented was introduced.
Risk Assessment and Management
Contractual Improvements In 2018 the group strived to ensure that any new supplier contracts contain express Modern Slavery and audit clauses to enable the Group to conduct a compliance audit in this area.
Risk Assessments In addition to ensuring that all suppliers with an obligation to do so publish a modern slavery statement, the Group utilises an external monitoring tool to regularly scrutinise our supply base for any indications that action to prevent modern slavery would be required.
Throughout the year, none of the supplier reviews conducted raised any concerns that Modern Slavery was prevalent within our supply chain.
Objectives for 2019 We are never complacent. We will continually review and refresh our risks and assessments in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking as part of our established risk universe; both as an employer and a purchaser of goods and services. In this context, in 2019 we will:
 Consolidate our policies, controls and approach to tackling modern slavery in light of the acquisition of Standard Life Assurance Limited
 Consider the application of enhanced reporting tools for monitoring adherence to the Modern Slavery Act within our supply base
 Consider the implementation of a programme of audits for suppliers where the risk may be considered high
Annual Review The Phoenix Group will continue to conduct an annual review of this Statement and the actions it takes to combat all forms of modern slavery internally and within its supply chain.

57,"Arrow Electronics, Inc. Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
For the Year Ended December 31, 2016
Introduction
Arrow Electronics, Inc. (hereinafter, “Arrow”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is firmly committed to maintaining the highest ethical and legal standards. We continually strive to comply with both the letter and spirit of all applicable laws and regulations. This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, and includes the activities of all our majority owned subsidiaries. Arrow maintains effective business controls as well as a dynamic and robust compliance program designed to detect and prevent violations of applicable laws, including laws regarding slavery, human trafficking and forced or compulsory labor, throughout our operations. Local policies and practices are reviewed and audited against corporate guidelines. Consequently, Arrow’s compliance program is not static but is ever evolving to meet changing business circumstances and regulations.
Employees are encouraged to contact Arrow’s law department, including the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer, or the finance department, including the Chief Financial Officer, with questions regarding any of our policies and practices. Employees also have the option of using Arrow’s AlertLine which is a confidential reporting line for all employees.
Arrow’s Structure
We are a global provider of products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions. Our Corporate Head Office is in Denver, Colorado, USA, however we have a global reach including multi sites within the UK and EMEA region. Arrow had sales in excess of $23bn in 2016.
Our Business
Our business is broadly organized into four divisions: ECS, Global Components, Arrow Value Recovery and Specialty Businesses.
Our Supply Chains
Arrow serves as a supply channel partner for over 100,000 original manufacturers, contract manufacturers and commercial customers through a global network.
Our Policy on Slavery and Human Trafficking
At Arrow, we are committed to ensuring that there is no slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labor or human trafficking in our supply chain or in any part of our businesses.
Arrow’s senior managers promote and encourage transparency, ethical conduct and a commitment to comply with anti-slavery and human trafficking laws. Our employees are provided with resources and training to help them meet Arrow’s ethical and legal obligations with regards to anti-slavery and human trafficking laws, including the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Arrow’s Worldwide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) is a central component of our overall compliance program. Arrow’s Code is administered by our Chief Compliance Officer and requires all employees to comply with the Code and obey the law. The Code contains policies aimed at combating slavery and human trafficking.
1

The audit committee of Arrow’s Board of Directors reviews the Code annually to ensure that it continues to meet or exceed the current regulatory framework and Arrow’s operational strategies.
Proposed changes to the Code are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors before being implemented and communicated to our employees. Additionally, the Board requires that all Arrow employees, officers and directors review and certify their understanding and acceptance of the Code annually. Arrow’s Code can be accessed on the company’s web site at: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=85834&p=irol-govConduct.
Arrow’s anti-bribery policies apply to all Arrow officers, directors, and employees worldwide and all of its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. Its general principles and prohibitions also apply to agents, distributors, consultants, and any other third parties acting on Arrow’s behalf, regardless of country of residence or citizenship.
Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk –
• Where possible we build long standing relationships with manufacturers, suppliers and customers and make clear our expectations of business behavior;
• With regards to our supply chains, we expect each entity to have suitable anti-slavery and human trafficking policies and processes, and we conduct third party due diligence in accordance with our procedures. We expect each entity to, at least, adopt ‘one-up’ due diligence on the next link in the chain. With the number of manufacturers and suppliers that we deal with on a regular basis, it would not be practical for Arrow (and every other participant in the chain) to have a direct relationship with all links in the supply chain, as this starts ultimately with the sourcing of the applicable raw materials;
• We have in place robust systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of ‘whistle blowers’. The Arrow AlertLine is a confidential means of reporting any concerns for all employees, in accordance with applicable local rules and regulations; and
• Failure to comply with anti-slavery laws will not be tolerated. Any Arrow employee who engages in conduct that results in a violation of these laws is subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Similarly, consultants, agents or third party service providers that provide services to or on behalf of Arrow should expect to have their contracts terminated if they violate anti-slavery laws.
Business Partner Adherence to Our Values
Arrow has a zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking. Arrow believes in the importance of its business partners to adhere to our high ethical and legal standards, and therefore requires all of its business partners to review and comply with our Business Partner Code of Conduct. This Code is based on the same principles as Arrow’s employee Code of Conduct. Arrow also offers training to its partners to make certain of their understanding of all applicable laws, rules and regulations while conducting Arrow business. The Business Partner Code of Conduct can be accessed on Arrow’s website at: http://www.arrow.com/about_arrow.
All managers are responsible for compliance in their respective departments and supplier relationships.
2

Training
Our compliance training program includes both online and instructor led training courses which are delivered in the local languages of our employees. Training covers many relevant topics including legal requirements and Arrow’s Code of Conduct, and we are currently engaged in expanding the training materials to specifically address the definition of modern slavery, and increase employee awareness on this issue, and have a tailored training scheduled for later this year. Additionally, we periodically provide key employees informational notices on high-risk issues, where a greater potential for bribery, corruption or practices in violation of the Code may exist.
Arrow maintains a strong whistle-blower program and provides protection for any employee who reports misconduct through confidential reporting and a clear no-retaliation policy. As part of our Open Door policy employees are encouraged to come forward with questions or information regarding observed improprieties, including any related to slavery and human trafficking. Arrow maintains the AlertLine twenty four hours a day/seven days a week, which provides employees with a mechanism for reporting to the Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel and, where appropriate, Arrow’s Board of Directors. Employees using the AlertLine have the option, where permitted by local law, to remain anonymous. Calls to Arrow’s AlertLine are responded to without delay. Details of the program are communicated to our Board of Directors as well as to our external auditors and the program is tested frequently throughout the year. Information on the AlertLine is included in the Code and is available on the company’s intranet sites across the regions as well as our public web site at: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=85834&p=irol-govConduct.
Our Effectiveness in Combatting Slavery and Human Trafficking
We use the following key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure how effective we have been in working to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chain:
• Use of payroll systems and HRIS to ensure that all employees are registered and paid fairly for the work they do;
• The building of relationships/partnerships with the next link in the supply chain and their understanding of, and compliance with, applicable laws and Arrow expectations;
• Measuring completed/outstanding trainings, and the corresponding increase in employees awareness of risk; and
• Monitoring Arrow AlertLine use and issue resolution.
For additional information about Arrow and our efforts to combat slavery, human trafficking and forced or compulsory labor, we are providing the following links to our public web site:

58,"MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2018
The Kraft Heinz Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries including H.J. Heinz Company Limited, H.J. Heinz Foods UK Limited and H.J. Heinz Manufacturing UK Limited (collectively “Kraft Heinz”) has continued its progress on its objective of Growing a Better World by enhancing the quality of people’s lives through sustainability, health and wellness and social responsibility. We believe the protection of human rights is fundamental to good business, and believe that we have both the ability and the responsibility to drive positive change through our global work. In support of this vision we are committed to respecting human rights in our own operations and throughout our global value chain. Kraft Heinz continues to place a high value on an ethical and transparent supply chain, and supports initiatives aimed to eradicate slavery and human trafficking. Kraft Heinz demands all business partners demonstrate a clear commitment to protecting the rights of workers worldwide, and does not tolerate the use of forced labour— including human trafficking and slavery. Kraft Heinz continues to partner with thousands of suppliers globally that are all committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery within the Kraft Heinz supply chain. From standard contractual clauses requiring compliance to the completion of audits and due diligence processes, Kraft Heinz is always evaluating the suppliers it uses and its own operations to ensure that they are operating with integrity, one of the company’s core principles.
Supply Chains Our supply chains are primarily focused on the sourcing, warehousing and transporting of the raw materials, ingredients and packaging required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products globally. All business partners, including but not limited to suppliers of raw materials, ingredients and packaging, are required to demonstrate a clear commitment to protecting the rights of workers worldwide. Specifically, suppliers are required to adhere to our Supplier Guiding Principles. Upon request, a supplier must certify its compliance with all such principles.
Policies on Slavery and Anti-Trafficking Internal Accountability Kraft Heinz is committed to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in any part of our business, including our supply chain. Each Kraft Heinz employee is expected to conduct business legally and ethically and comply with certain established company standards, including but not limited to the prohibition of forced labour and the employment of anyone under the local legal working age. All such standards are outlined in the Employee Code of Conduct. Failure to meet the Kraft Heinz standards on forced labour or minimum age requirements is a violation of corporate policy. Violators are subject to disciplinary action, up to

and including termination of employment.
Training The most recent version of the Kraft Heinz Employee Code of Conduct is accessible to all employees globally. Kraft Heinz utilises a modular training programme for the various components of the Employee Code of Conduct, meaning the focus of the trainings is established in accordance with the employee’s function within the company. Kraft Heinz has enhanced the rigour and extent of training being provided to its employees, specifically with regard to those in roles that are more readily exposed to scenarios where forced labour may arise. This targeted and pro-active practice furthers Kraft Heinz's commitment to protecting the rights of workers worldwide, meaning we are better poised than ever to identify actual or potential human rights violations in our supply chain . The increased levels of training provided by Kraft Heinz help us manage human rights protection in our business.
Certification by Direct Suppliers Kraft Heinz purchasing contracts require suppliers to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the fulfilment of its duties under the contract and to adhere to the principles contained in the Supplier Guiding Principles. Suppliers are required to certify their compliance with the Supplier Guiding Principles at the request of Kraft Heinz, and are required to permit Kraft Heinz and its designated agents (including any third parties) to engage in monitoring activities, including on-site inspections. If the supplier is unable to resolve any issues Kraft Heinz reserves the right to take additional action against the supplier, including but not limited to termination of the business relationship.
Supplier Compliance Audits Kraft Heinz reserves the right, either through itself or a designated third party, to verify a supplier’s compliance with the principles contained in the Supplier Guiding Principles. If Kraft Heinz becomes aware of any supplier actions or conditions not in compliance with Kraft Heinz’s communicated standards, including the principles contained in the Supplier Guiding Principles, such actions or conditions are subject to review by Kraft Heinz. Kraft Heinz reserves the right to require corrective actions be taken and/or to terminate any such agreement with a supplier.
Verification and Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Anti-trafficking Kraft Heinz believes a critical aspect of a resilient, effective Anti-Slavery and Anti-Trafficking approach sits within the due diligence process. We undertake both internal and external practices to assess potential negative human rights impacts in our business operations and global supply chain. Assessment - Kraft Heinz is conducting a risk assessment to identify potential and actual negative human rights impacts. This includes an evaluation of geographical, economic and social criteria to determine points our value chain where risk is highest, and where we can next make the

greatest impact. Management - We will use the information obtained in the risk assessment process and stakeholder feedback to further inform our efforts to prevent, mitigate and manage human rights risk, including integration into day-to-day operations, relevant internal and external risk management systems, training protocols and the implementation of several global policies. Kraft Heinz is committed to addressing any adverse human rights impacts which we have caused or to which we have contributed, and expect our suppliers, business partners and other relevant stakeholders to do the same. Reports from any party received through our Grievance Mechanism or any other medium, are reviewed within 24 hours by the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer during a preliminary assessment, and further addressed by executive leadership as appropriate. We do not tolerate retaliation and anonymity is guaranteed. We have not and will not impede the access to state-based judicial or nonjudicial mechanisms for any persons raising allegations through our Grievance Mechanism. Tracking – Going forward, Kraft Heinz will track the effectiveness of its management of negative human rights impacts through the monitoring of and engagement with our suppliers, business partners and other relevant stakeholders. Kraft Heinz will provide biennial public disclosure on its effectiveness. Communications - Kraft Heinz actively communicates the human rights guiding principles and expectations set out in our Global Human Rights Policy to employees, suppliers, business partners and other stakeholders via both disclosure and engagement. The Policy is public via the Kraft Heinz Corporate Website and also internally. When needed, local translation is provided. Grievance Mechanisms - Kraft Heinz provides several ways for employees, suppliers, business partners and other stakeholders to raise concerns or complaints. This includes the reporting of potential misconduct to managers, Human Resource professionals, the Legal Department and the Ethics & Compliance team, and our confidential Ethics & Compliance Hotline. The Hotline is open to all stakeholders, including rightsholders, is maintained by a third-party provider and has multilingual staff available 24 hours a day. Reports can be made via country-specific toll-free phone numbers, or online.
Measuring our effectiveness Kraft Heinz will continue to update its policies and procedures applicable to its supply chain as Kraft Heinz, our brands and our supply chain evolves.

59,"Merlin Entertainments plc Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
for the year ended 31 December 2016
Introduction
Merlin Entertainments recognises its moral and legal responsibility with regard to Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking and will always endeavour to ensure that no such activities arise in the operation of its business. We expect all areas of our business and all suppliers and contractors to comply with internationally recognised codes of practice on human rights, employment practices and working conditions. We undertake a thorough assessment of each supplier against the principles of the SA8000 international standard of social compliance. For certain procurement areas, we also assess suppliers against standards set out in the International Labour Organisation Convention, the United Nation Convention on the Rights of a Child, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Business Structure
Merlin Entertainments plc is a global leader in location based, family entertainment. As Europe's Number 1 and the world's second-largest visitor attraction operator, Merlin now operates over 100 attractions, 13 hotels and five holiday villages in 24 countries and across four continents. The company aims to deliver memorable experiences to more than 63 million visitors worldwide, through global and local brands, and employs c.27,000 employees (peak season).
The business is split into three main operating groups; Midway Attractions, LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks. In addition the New Openings division takes responsibility for all new attractions and the integration of acquisitions. The three operating groups along with New Openings are supported by a central corporate team and Merlin Magic Making, our unique internal creative and production resource.
Procurement policies and strategy are centrally-led and locally implemented, with commitments to suppliers made by each attraction and operating company under the delegated authority principle.
Our policies
We are committed to ensuring that no Modern Slavery or Human Trafficking exists in any form within our business or our supply chains. As an organisation operating in multiple jurisdictions, we will always comply with local laws and regulations, however where these fall short of our own global standards and policies, we will always aim to go above and beyond local legislation to maintain a high common ethical standard.
Our Human Rights Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business activity and relationships. We strive to prevent

discrimination and to value diversity throughout our business, and to provide a safe, secure and healthy environment within which to work.
In addition, and in line with our commitment to act with integrity in all our business dealings, we also operate the following policies and codes which have relevancy to the Modern Slavery Act. Together these provide a policy framework that addresses the principal provisions within the Act:
 Whistleblowing Policy. The Company encourages all employees, workers and contractors to report any concerns relating to the direct activities, or supply chains of the Company. The policy is designed to make it easy for employees to make disclosures without fear of retaliation through using an independent externally hosted Whistleblowing Hotline that is available to all employees in all languages, regardless of where they are in the world. This service is also available to contractors employed to work on behalf of Merlin.
 Employee Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour expected of them at all times when representing the Company. The Company strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour in all its operations and the Code of Conduct makes clear that breach of any policy will not be tolerated. All employees are required to formally acknowledge that they have read, understood and will adhere to the content of the Code of Conduct. Their declaration also serves as formal acknowledgement of all Company policies referred to within the Code (including policies in relation to modern slavery). Through the Code of Conduct employees are made fully aware that breach of any policy, or failure to raise concerns, may lead to disciplinary action and ultimately lead to dismissal.
 Equal Opportunities Policy. Available to all UK employees and extended to other regions based upon local laws. It states all employees should be treated with dignity, respect and consideration at work and does not discriminate against them because of sex, age, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, sexual orientation, disability, race, colour, nationality, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, maternity or pregnancy. The Company aims to treat all employees, former employees, clients, suppliers and other members of the public with whom the Company comes into contact, with dignity and respect.
 Recruitment Policy and Code of Practice. These global policies uphold the Equal Opportunities and Human Rights policies through ensuring that all candidates are treated with dignity and respect, and that all applications are handled equally.
 Protection of Children and Young Workers. This global policy states our commitment to protecting children and younger workers under the age of 18. It clearly states the Company does not tolerate unfair treatment of children or young workers in the workplace and that maximum working hours, working conditions and fair treatment be adhered to at all times. Risk assessments are carried out before employing young workers, and the Company strives to ensure that child welfare takes priority over business concerns.

 Fraud Policy. The Company has zero tolerance towards fraud or bribery. Facilitation payments by anyone representing Merlin are prohibited anywhere in the world. This policy extends to anyone acting on behalf of the Company as well as to suppliers, consultants and contractors. Such third parties are required to agree in writing to comply with Merlin's Fraud policy and Merlin conducts due diligence before establishing joint ventures and/or engaging consultants, contractors and suppliers.
 Retail Merchandiser Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct and Global Sourcing Principles establish the standards for commercial suppliers working for Merlin. As business relationships develop, we expect suppliers to comply with internationally recognised codes of practice on Human Rights, employment practices and working conditions. These documents specifically require suppliers to achieve and maintain standards in relation to the following:
o Prevention of child labour;
o Prevention of forced labour;
o Prevention of slave and trafficked labour;
o Ensuring safety;
o Health and hygiene;
o Associations, discrimination and coercion;
o Working hours and wages; and
o Protection of the environment.
Suppliers
Our supply chains include local, national and international partners and the Company will not knowingly do business with parties who violate applicable laws and regulations, including local, environmental and employment laws.
All suppliers are required to sign as a condition of doing business, Merlin Entertainments’ Standard Terms and Conditions of Purchase which contain our Ethical Dealing Principles. Our Ethical Dealing Principles require suppliers to be compliant with international conventions in relation to forced labour; freedom of association; right to organise and collective bargaining; equal remuneration; abolition of forced labour; discrimination; minimum age and child labour; the European Convention on Human Rights and European Money Laundering Convention. When signing our standard terms and conditions for commercial activity, suppliers also agree to adhere to the Retail Merchandiser Code of Conduct.
The Company has several systems in place to identify and assess potential risks in our supply chain, mitigate these risks and protect whistle-blowers. These include:

 requiring all commercial suppliers to comply with our Human Rights Policy and Retail Merchandiser Code of Conduct through signing the Merlin Entertainments Standard Terms and Conditions of Purchase;
 binding all suppliers to ethical dealing clauses in all contract terms and conditions;
 holding regular review meetings with all major commercial suppliers and brand partners which focus on the delivery of goods and services in line with the terms of our agreement;
 independently auditing certain categories of commercial suppliers, who produce Merlin Entertainments branded products, against the Merlin Social Audit Report;
 Merlin has a specific team responsible for compliance within areas of supply that are deemed 'high risk'. 'High risk' commercial suppliers are regularly audited to ensure continued compliance against our standards. Where factories fall beneath the required standards, corrective action plans are created and timescales for improvements agreed. A second audit will follow to ensure agreed standards are then being met; failure of a second audit will automatically delist the supplier;
 invoking strict sanctions on suppliers who do not meet our performance expectations or uphold the terms of our agreement. For example, any evidence of child labour results in the immediate delisting of a supplier, as does failure of two audit results;
 use of an independent externally hosted Whistleblowing Hotline which all employees, workers and contractors are made aware of upon induction and encouraged to use whenever appropriate. This is commissioned by the Company's Audit Committee which receives regular reports.
Training
All commercial staff involved in the procurement of goods and services receive training on our Merlin Ethical Dealing Principles, which form part of our contractual terms and conditions of supply, in addition to the policies and procedures that underpin monitoring and compliance.
As our business expands geographically and transforms its theme parks into short break destinations, we are mindful of the increased risks relating to modern slavery associated with new market entry and high volume employment sectors such as accommodation and food and beverage operations. We ensure we abide by all local labour laws and enact awareness training for our management teams on human rights and employee welfare.

Effectiveness / Performance Review The Company understands that Modern Slavery risk is continually evolving, and will seek to take steps beyond current practices to monitor the performance of our measures to detect and prevent Modern Slavery in our supply chains. In particular, we are taking steps to:
 increase sanctions on and immediately de-list any supplier who is using slave or trafficked labour (further to just child labour);
 extend our risk profiling beyond commercial suppliers, categorising risk levels within the supplier base and attributing respective incremental measures of compliance; and
 enhance training specific to modern slavery given to all commercial staff involved in managing the supply chain, and engaging in purchasing or logistics activity.
Merlin will always seek to do the right thing by its employee and its communities and therefore operates within a framework of continuous self-assessment and improvement.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2016. It has been approved by the Board of Directors of Merlin Entertainments plc.

The NSG Group has around 27,000 permanent employees worldwide.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking:
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. This commitment is reflected in the following Group Policies and Codes:
NSG Group Code of Ethics NSG Group HR Policy NSG Group Employment Policy NSG Group Procurement Policy NSG Group Supplier Code of Conduct
A. Employees
As part of the sustainability processes already in place, Regional Human Resource Directors are asked to confirm on an annual basis that
Recruitment systems are in place to prevent forced labour No NSG Companies have been convicted for the use of forced or bonded labour Processes are in place for employees to report any concerns on human rights
In this connection, “forced labour” is defined as all work and service which is extracted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered her/himself voluntarily.
B. Suppliers:
Our supply chain consists of more than 30,000 active suppliers around the world. This supply chain is managed by our Group Procurement which operates as a single global function, structured across all Business Lines. We develop and implement best-fit strategies for each category to deliver maximum value from the supply base in the areas of cost and risk management, sustainability, innovation, and growth.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct specifically covers this area. It is communicated to all current and new suppliers and we have already obtained agreement to its provisions from the majority of our key contracted suppliers We operate a supplier sustainability programme, which has detailed questions on compliance with labour laws. We audit suppliers under PPD 017 which also covers this area. All outsourced manufacturing is required to undergo due diligence which includes screening, reputation monitoring and due diligence questionnaires.
C. Other Business Partners
Business partners that provide services to NSG Group are assessed to determine if they are an antibribery/anti-corruption (ABAC) risk. As with our suppliers, those meeting ABAC criteria undergo due diligence, assessment and reputational monitoring. This includes agents, consultants and joint venture partners.
Effectiveness of our Efforts
We use various methods to determine the effectiveness of our efforts to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:
Completion of internal audits by Group Internal Audit on minimum controls and compliance program requirements. Ethics & Compliance Hotline which is available to all NSG Group employees and third parties to report suspected violations of human rights. Reporters may be anonymous in most countries and all reporters are protected from retaliation in any form. Training of managers and staff on our Code of Ethics. Periodic review our policies and procedures to help maintain compliance with internal policy and external laws.
There have been no audit findings, due diligence findings or reported incidents of slavery and human trafficking within NSG Group or its supply chain to date.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our Group’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March, 2018.

Modern Slavery Statement 2019/20

Our latest statement, published in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, sets out the steps Standard Life Aberdeen (Standard Life Aberdeen plc and each of its UK subsidiary commercial organisations) has taken during the year ending 31 December 2019 to help prevent modern slavery in our operations and supply chain.

All forms of modern slavery - from human trafficking and forced labour, to bonded labour and child slavery – have no place in our society. As a global investment company we want to do all that we can to help tackle these issues. We are committed to operating ethically, raising awareness of modern slavery issues, and encouraging good practices among our
suppliers and the companies we invest in.
Mike Tumilty, Global Chief Operating Officer and executive sponsor

Our purpose
Together we invest for a better future. We do it to make a difference to the lives of our clients and customers, our employees, society and our shareholders.
Our business
We meet the evolving needs of investors and savers. We do this by building lasting relationships and developing innovative products and services. We offer:
• Active asset management to institutional, wholesale and strategic insurance clients • Wealth management, financial planning and advice services, either directly to
customers or through financial advisers.

What we’ve done this year at a glance
Launched a new modern slavery standalone training module and assessment for our people

We also have significant holdings in associate and joint venture businesses: Phoenix in the UK, HDFC Life and HDFC Asset Management in India and Heng An Standard Life in China.
See our legal structure

Joined the “Find it, Fix it, Prevent it” investor collaboration

We are headquartered in Scotland and listed in London, with around 6,000 employees in over 50 locations worldwide. 13% are contractors and 83% are represented by a staff association or trade union.
See our global locations
We work with around 5,000 suppliers who provide us with various goods and services. The majority of our spending is with suppliers of fully managed outsourced services, IT, professional services, and goods and services related to management of our premises.
We have a modern slavery working group with cross-business representatives from procurement, legal, sustainability, risk, compliance, company secretariat and ESG investment who ensure we continuously review and improve our approach. Mike Tumilty, Global Chief Operating Officer, is the executive sponsor.

Engaged with investee companies on modern slavery issues and reported transparently on our discussions
Performed a regular risk assessment of our highest risk suppliers with a third party

The UK financial services industry is not considered a high risk sector for modern slavery. However, we are not complacent and recognise the possibility that modern slavery issues may exist somewhere in our supply chain. We expect transparency from our suppliers and will work with our business partners to support them in driving positive change. In the event that we did become aware of any modern slavery issues within any of our supply chains, this would be escalated to senior management through our enterprise risk management framework and appropriate action taken - depending on the circumstances, this may range from supporting a supplier to make a positive change to terminating the relationship with a supplier.

We also recognise that the biggest impact we can make is through our investment approach, engaging directly with high-risk companies and encouraging better practices.

2 Modern Slavery Statement 2019/20

Investment approach
A key way we can drive change is through how we invest. We incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into our investment approach across all asset classes. We take our responsibilities as an investor seriously and seek to encourage the adoption of best-practice ESG standards. We expect that the companies in which we invest meet internationally recognised modern slavery standards and industry best practices. We also expect companies to report to shareholders regarding policies, practices and the performance of all the steps taken to address modern slavery issues. Where we believe a company is exposed to modern slavery risk and not taking action to mitigate this, we will incorporate this into our investment view and engage with the company to drive positive change.
We are a founding member of The Investor Forum, through which we participate in collaborative projects to tackle modern slavery in high risk sectors. We also support initiatives in collaboration with industry peers and nongovernmental organisations to advocate for better enforcement of anti-modern slavery legislation. An example of this is the “Find it, Fix it, Prevent it” investor initiative launched by CCLA and industry organisations and academics, designed to encourage UK businesses to find and help victims of slavery within their operations and supply chain. The first sector which will be focused on in this project is the hospitality industry.

investment approach

Engagement case study Barratt Developments
The UK’s largest house builder, Barratt Developments, is a company we hold in the UK Equity Impact – Employment Opportunities Fund. This fund aims to use capital as a source for strong financial returns and force for social good through supporting creation of quality jobs across the UK.
We prioritise our engagements based on risk and materiality. As the construction industry is in one of the high risk sectors for modern slavery, we spoke to the company to find out how it is managing this risk in its supply chain. We learned that the company has taken a number of positive steps: It is the first national house builder to sign up to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority’s Construction Protocol; it has included modern slavery requirements in the contractual relationships with its suppliers; it has installed a confidential helpline for reporting suspicious incidents; it has put up anti-modern slavery posters on sites to help workers spot signs of slave labour; and it carries out audits on suppliers assessed as high risk.
The company has confirmed to us that it has found no incident of modern slavery in its own operations or supply chain. However, given the prevalence of this issue in the construction industry, we encouraged Barratt Developments to keep up its scrutiny of suppliers further down the chain.

Policies
We have a number of policies and statements, collectively demonstrating our approach to identifying and mitigating modern slavery risks:
Global code of conduct
Our global code of conduct describes the principles and standards that we hold ourselves to and we ask all our employees to consider these in every decision and action that they take. Within the code, we specifically highlight our commitment to tackling modern slavery.
Our employees receive training on the content and meaning of the code, and are required, at least annually, to confirm that they have read and agree to abide by its principles.
Supplier code of conduct
Our supplier code of conduct sets out the standards we expect from our suppliers. It specifically highlights the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 as well as our wider interest and focus on ensuring that human rights and labour standards are respected. We ask our suppliers to inform us if they have any issues or concerns.
We support freedom of association and collective bargaining
Other policies (third party management, outsourcing, corporate transactions, and people)
These policies form part of our enterprise risk management framework and support our commitment to tackling modern slavery through our interactions with our suppliers, our people, and new business partners. Each policy owner is required to complete and sign-off a quarterly certification confirming the business area’s adherence to the policy, and where necessary, develop action plans to resolve any issues of non-compliance with policy standards. Regular updates on policy compliance are reported to our Board-level Risk and Capital Committee.

Modern Slavery Statement 2019/20 3

Speak up hotline
If our employees identify any issues relating to modern slavery we encourage them to report this to their manager. If they feel uncomfortable raising their concern using their normal reporting line, or wish to do so anonymously, an independently managed confidential speak up hotline is available. All concerns raised are taken seriously and anyone raising a concern will not be at risk of losing their job or suffering any form of reprisal as a result, even if the concern is proved to be unfounded. This hotline is also advertised to our suppliers who can use it in the same way. All reports received are investigated and appropriate action taken. In 2019 we received no calls related to modern slavery.

Training
To raise awareness amongst our employees of both modern slavery and the speak up arrangements available to them, this year we provided a new standalone modern slavery learning module for all our people to complete. This online training provides details on how to identify modern slavery, relevant requirements of legislation across the globe, and what action to take. 92% of our people have completed the 2019 training and the accompanying assessment to test their understanding. We provide modern slavery training to all our people on at least an annual basis.
Due diligence and risk assessment of suppliers
We want to reduce the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain. Heightened modern slavery and human trafficking risk exists in relation to certain territories, and in relation to the production of certain goods and supplies.
During 2019 we continued to work with a third party who performed an independent risk assessment of the suppliers we work with that we have identified as presenting the greatest risk of modern slavery. The initial output from this activity is that none of the suppliers assessed by the third party are deemed high risk. We will continue to review our suppliers in this way and will take appropriate action if any are identified as being high risk.
In 2020 we are evolving our risk assessment of suppliers to further inform our responsible sourcing decisions, and develop and enhance our compliance with our regulatory obligations.

Measurement
Our progress against our key performance indicators established in 2018 is as follows:
1.	We raise awareness amongst our employees of modern slavery issues and how to respond 92% of our people have completed our 2019 modern slavery online training.
2.	We complete modern slavery risk assessments of our Suppliers In 2019 we continued using the third party service to assess a subset of our suppliers operating in specific sectors and countries – none were deemed to be high risk. In 2020 we will continue to evolve and strengthen our risk assessment of suppliers and use this to inform our sourcing decisions and supplier management approach.
3.	Modern slavery considerations are integrated into our investment process See section ‘Investment approach’ which details our Integration and provides an engagement example.

62,"UK HUMAN TRAFFICKING TRANSPARENCY STATEMENT Marriott Hotels Ltd is publishing this statement in compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. It details the steps taken by Marriott Hotels Ltd and its parent company, Marriott International, Inc., to aid in the prevention of modern slavery and human trafficking during the year ending on 31 December 2016.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF KEY ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED
2006 Established Human Rights Policy 2011 Launched first human rights child exploitation awareness training 2011 Updated supplier code of conduct to include human rights standard 2014 Updated annual ethical conduct survey to include questions around human rights policy 2015 Developed robust new human trafficking training in partnership with ECPAT-USA and
collaborated with Polaris and AH&LA (American Hotel and Lodging Association) 2016 Began global rollout of comprehensive training on human trafficking, forced labor and
child exploitation
“HOW WE DO BUSINESS IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE BUSINESS WE DO.” Marriott International’s Executive Chairman, J.W. Marriott, Jr.’s belief describes our pledge to conduct business in an ethical manner and commitment to responsible business values. The Marriott name is on nearly 6,000 managed and franchised properties in 120 countries and territories around the world. This statement applies to Marriott International, Inc.’s corporate offices, managed, leased and owned hotels. We work with and encourage our owners and franchise partners to adopt similar policies within their businesses. Marriott’s Business Conduct Guide, available in 15 languages reinforces the importance of our corporate values and ethical responsibility, can be found here. An overview of our business and corporate structure can be found on our corporate website here.
OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY AND PRINCIPLES OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS At Marriott, we are committed to demonstrating our core values and a company culture that represent the highest standards of guest and associate experience, ethics, integrity and corporate citizenship which is reflected in our Principles of Responsible Business. In 2006, we published our Human Rights Policy establishing a foundation for managing our business around the world in accordance with all applicable laws. Marriott’s Human Rights Policy and Principles are guided by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and Sustainable Development Goals, as well as related international covenants. Our collective efforts on human rights are outlined in our Commitment of Human Rights statement. We recognize the important role of business to respect human rights and work together with other stakeholders to address global human rights challenges such as modern slavery, human trafficking and the exploitation of children.
GOVERNANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE Marriott’s work on human rights, including human trafficking, is overseen by an internal Human Rights Council that represents leaders across multiple business disciplines. Marriott also has a dedicated Director-level corporate associate who has expertise on and is responsible for human rights issues.
Marriott implements an ongoing risk management process to identify, prevent and mitigate relevant human rights risks. Our internal audit department conducts an annual Ethical Conduct Survey across a broad section

of associates, including all officers and senior managers. We provide associates with a variety of means, including anonymous channels, to report unethical behaviour. This includes a toll-free international Business Integrity Hotline. The Company does not tolerate any retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith and has policies in place to protect such individuals.
Since 2006, Marriott has implemented the Marriott Incident Reporting Application (MIRA), which is an online system for gathering and reporting security-related incidents, including human trafficking, for properties managed by Marriott. Our global managed properties are required to enter incidents into MIRA within 24 hours after the incident occurred or was reported. Critical incidents, such as human trafficking, are flagged by the system for immediate follow-up.
In 2017, we will add new criteria to our internal property certification audit to survey the compliance with the new human trafficking training requirement. These audits are conducted on a biannual basis to ensure that our properties are meeting specific requirements.
OUR EFFORTS TO PREVENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING Marriott implements a variety of practices that help to prevent human trafficking through associate engagement and training, supply chain sustainability, and responsible recruitment practices.
 HUMAN RIGHTS TRAINING: We introduced our first ‘Human Rights and the Protection of Children Training’ in 2011. This training was also included in the Loss Prevention Certification program aimed for security staff offered through the American Hotel and Lodging Association. In June 2016, we began rolling out new and expanded online human rights training addressing human trafficking, child exploitation and forced labour in 15 languages. The purpose of the training is to raise awareness of all forms of human trafficking and educate our associates on the indicators and what they can do should they suspect potential issues. The enhanced training was launched in Europe in November and nearly 1,700 associates in the region have voluntarily completed the training.
 SUPPLY CHAIN SUSTAINABILITY: Marriott collaborates with suppliers in three channels of our supply chain— furniture, fixture and equipment (FF&E), operating supplies and equipment (OS&E) and food and beverage—as part of our overall sustainability strategy. Marriott encourages its suppliers and contractors around the world to adopt the same ethical business standards and human rights compliance it supports. Global contracts currently executed by Marriott require contractors to comply with Marriott’s Global Supplier Code of Conduct, which is available in multiple languages and sent out to suppliers as part of a continent-wide awareness campaign and includes standards on forced labor consistent with the Company’s Human Rights Policy.
Associates with procurement and purchasing responsibilities are required to complete our Procurement 101 online training, which includes information on our human rights policies. In 2016, over 5,000 associates globally completed the training.
ETHICAL RECRUITMENT: Marriott recognizes that some individuals may try to exploit and fraudulently recruit potential employees on behalf of our Company. In an effort to raise awareness of and prevent recruitment scams, we have developed guidance for jobseekers and a list of approved Marriott e-mail domains that can be found here. Marriott managed hotels do not require payment of a fee to be considered

for employment. We also do not accept job applications via email or fax. Our complete statement on recruitment scams can be found here.
In the UK, where we may use third-party temporary worker agencies/vendors, we include in our vendor agreements the necessary reference to adherence to Marriott’s Human Rights Policy.
EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND PROGRAMS Marriott engages and collaborates with strategic external partners to support and develop programs that address the root causes of exploitation. We also help vulnerable young people prepare for and find meaningful employment through a range of partnerships.
Marriott continues to support and promote global efforts on human trafficking through our engagement with our industry peers and diverse organizations to promote social responsibility, including collaborative efforts to address human trafficking:
 INTERNATIONAL TOURISM PARTNERSHIP: Marriott is a founding member of the International Tourism Partnership (ITP). Through our membership, we collaborate with other global hospitality companies to address critical issues that affect our industry and actively contribute to key industry initiatives such as the creation of the Industry Position Statement on Human Trafficking, Supply Chain Working Group riskmapping which highlighted agency and construction workers as a high-risk area for trafficking, and internal and external stakeholder surveys and engagement.
 NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS: For nearly 20 years, Marriott has offered the Youth Career Initiative (YCI), a 24-week education and life enhancing program for young people at risk, at our hotels in nine countries and territories within Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. To date, thousands of students have graduated from YCI programs around the world and have gone on to pursue careers in hospitality, banking and health care, or have continued with further education. Nearly 900 of those graduates were trained at Marriott hotels, including students who are survivors of human trafficking.
In 2016, Marriott collaborated with End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes (ECPAT-USA) and Polaris to co-develop the content of our enhanced human rights training. Marriott received ECPAT-USA’s Changemaker for Protection Award for this project. We also partnered with the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AH&LA) to make the training widely available to other hospitality companies and academia.
Looking forward, we will be requiring human trafficking training in 2017 for managed and franchised properties. We will be working to train associates from eleven new brands acquired through Marriott International’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on our human rights policies, standards and programs. In 2017, we plan to launch new sustainability targets and goals, inclusive of human trafficking prevention, as we work towards full integration of both companies. We will continue to work with our peer colleagues and the broader hospitality industry on efforts to address human rights issues within our sphere of influence.

63,"MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT
This statement is made on behalf of Generation Investment Management LLP (“Generation” or “we”) pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”). It describes the steps Generation has taken during the financial year ended 31 December 2016 to seek reassurance that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains, or in any part of its own business.
ABOUT GENERATION
Generation is a boutique investment management firm modelled on an independent, broad-based employee-owned partnership structure, and is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom. Generation is the parent entity of Generation Investment Management US LLP (“Generation US”), an investment adviser registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
Generation’s principal activity is the provision of investment management services to institutional clients and other sophisticated investors through four strategies: Global Equity, Asia Equity, Growth Equity, and Global Credit. We are dedicated to investing in sustainable companies that provide goods and services consistent with a low-carbon, prosperous, equitable, healthy and safe society. Through engagement with our clients, our portfolio companies and the broader financial market, we strive to promote a more sustainable form of capitalism. We expect the highest ethical standards in our work and personal lives, and recognise and accept our responsibility to the communities in which we live and work, and to the world community.
Generation is strongly opposed to slavery, and is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all its business dealings and relationships. This commitment is embedded in our culture through our vision, mission and values (accessible here), and our human rights principles are embedded in our firm-wide policies, procedures, and codes of conduct which cover both Generation and Generation US.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS AND MEASURES TAKEN TO PREVENT MODERN SLAVERY
We believe that, as an investment firm dedicated to sustainable capitalism with relatively straightforward and short supply chains, the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring in our business or supply chains is low. By value, the substantial majority of our suppliers are financial and professional services organisations, including banks, lawyers, accountants, consultants, insurers and recruitment agencies. Other suppliers include providers of IT, software, office and stationary equipment, catering, office cleaning and other facilities management providers.
Notwithstanding the relatively low risk, we understand the importance of combatting slavery and human trafficking and are committed to ensuring that modern slavery is not taking place in our business or our supply chains. We have taken a risk-based approach to monitor our business and suppliers, which we believe allows us to allocate resources appropriately and effectively. Our processes followed during 2016 are outlined below.
In relation to our supply chains, we are committed to engaging ethical suppliers providing quality products and services. We conduct appropriate due diligence on new suppliers, which include questions relating to suppliers’ environmental, social and governance practices to seek assurance that suppliers share our commitment to these metrics. Our due diligence review takes into account the materiality of the supplier and the level of risk of modern slavery occurring within such supplier’s business or supply chain. Depending on the circumstances, a supplier may be required to provide additional information on the approach it takes to its people and the workers in its supply chain. As part of our contracting process, we seek to incorporate provisions into the supplier and adviser engagements which require compliance with applicable laws and regulations (which would include the Act). We tend to foster long-term relationships with our selected suppliers, and refresh our diligence on key suppliers periodically to determine whether further enquiries should be made. We avoid making demands of any of our suppliers that we believe would conflict with our commitment to high ethical standards and human right principles.

In relation to our professionals, Generation’s mission is to attract and retain professionals whom share a commitment to our values. Our employees are hired in accordance with robust and fair recruitment policies and procedures, and are expected to adhere to Generation’s Code of Conduct, which reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. In the event that an employee uncovers any potential misconduct, including concerns around modern slavery, he/she is encouraged to report such to senior management.
In relation to our portfolio companies, we take our commitment to tackle modern slavery and human trafficking seriously, and consider being an engaged shareholder an integral part of responsible ownership. Part of Generation’s investment approach involves a vigorous management quality assessment, significant elements of which are human capital management and corporate governance. Our investment analysts maintain constructive dialogue with investee companies, interact with management teams on a regular basis and engage them on topics that include relevant and material sustainability issues, including human rights issues. Generation’s response to the UK Stewardship Code can be found here.
TRAINING
We believe that the training of people is an effective way to raise awareness of issues around modern slavery. Our senior management team and professionals involved in the procurement of products or services from third parties, including our IT, human resources and office service functions, are well aware of our commitment to fair employment practices. All employees are required to complete mandatory training on bribery and anti-money laundering, and we are planning to provide additional training to help all employees identify the key issues and indicators of modern slavery and how these should be addressed.
FURTHER STEPS
We recognise that policies and procedures seeking to address modern slavery risks require ongoing review to identify potential enhancements. We will continue to review our processes and controls to determine where enhancements may be warranted.
This statement has been approved on behalf of the members of Generation Investment Management LLP.

Introduction
Merlin Entertainments plc (“Merlin” or “the Company”) recognises its moral and legal responsibility with regard to modern slavery and human trafficking and will always endeavour to ensure that no such activities arise in the operation of its business. We expect all areas of our business and all suppliers and contractors to comply with internationally recognised codes of practice on human rights, employment practices and working conditions. We undertake a thorough assessment of each supplier against the principles of the SA8000 international standard of social compliance. For certain procurement areas, we also assess suppliers against standards set out in the International Labour Organisation Convention, the United Nation Convention on the Rights of a Child, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Business Structure
Merlin Entertainments plc is a global leader in location based, family entertainment. As Europe's Number 1 and the world's second-largest visitor attraction operator, Merlin now operates over 130 attractions, 20 hotels and six holiday villages in 25 countries and across four continents. The company aims to deliver memorable experiences to 67 million visitors worldwide, through global and local brands, and employs c.28,000 employees (peak season).
The business is split into three main operating groups; Midway Attractions, LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks. In addition the New Openings division takes responsibility for all new attractions and the integration of acquisitions. The three operating groups along with New Openings are supported by a central corporate team and Merlin Magic Making, our unique internal creative and production resource.
Procurement policies and strategy are centrally-led and locally implemented, with commitments to suppliers made by each attraction and operating company under the delegated authority principle.
Our policies
We are committed to ensuring that no modern slavery or human trafficking exists in any form within our business or our supply chains. As an organisation operating in multiple jurisdictions, we will always comply with local laws and regulations, however where these fall short of our own global standards and

policies, we will always aim to go above and beyond local legislation to maintain a high common ethical standard.
Our Human Rights Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business activity and relationships. We strive to prevent discrimination and to value diversity throughout our business, and to provide a safe, secure and healthy environment within which to work.
In addition, and in line with our commitment to act with integrity in all our business dealings, we also operate the following policies and codes which have relevancy to the Modern Slavery Act. Together these provide a policy framework that addresses the principal provisions within the Act.
• Whistleblowing Policy. The Company encourages all employees, workers and contractors to report any concerns relating to the direct activities, or supply chains of the Company. The policy is designed to make it easy for employees to make disclosures without fear of retaliation through using an independent externally hosted Whistleblowing Hotline that is available to all employees in all languages, regardless of where they are in the world. This service is also available to contractors employed to work on behalf of Merlin.
• Employee Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour expected of them at all times when representing the Company. The Company strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour in all its operations and the Code of Conduct makes clear that breach of any policy will not be tolerated. All employees are required to formally acknowledge that they have read, understood and will adhere to the content of the Code of Conduct. Their declaration also serves as formal acknowledgement of all Company policies referred to within the Code (including policies in relation to modern slavery). Through the Code of Conduct employees are made fully aware that breach of any policy, or failure to raise concerns, may lead to disciplinary action and ultimately lead to dismissal.
• Equal Opportunities Policy. Available to all UK employees and extended to other regions based upon local laws. It states all employees should be treated with dignity, respect and consideration at work and does not discriminate against them because of sex, age, gender reassignment, marital or civil partner status, sexual orientation, disability, race, colour, nationality, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, maternity or pregnancy. The Company aims to treat all employees, former employees, clients, suppliers and other members of the public with whom the Company comes into contact, with dignity and respect.
• Recruitment Policy and Code of Practice. These global policies uphold the Equal Opportunities and Human Rights policies through ensuring that all candidates are treated with dignity and respect, and that all applications are handled equally.
• Protection of Children and Young Workers. This global policy states our commitment to protecting children and younger workers under the age of 18. It clearly states the Company does not tolerate unfair treatment of children or young workers in the workplace and that maximum working hours, working conditions and fair treatment be adhered to at all times. Risk assessments are carried out before employing young workers, and the Company takes all measures to ensure that child welfare takes priority over business concerns.
• Anti-Bribery and Fraud Policy. The Company has zero tolerance towards fraud or bribery. Facilitation payments by anyone representing Merlin are prohibited anywhere in the world. This policy extends to anyone acting on behalf of the Company as well as to suppliers, consultants and contractors. Such third parties are required to agree in writing to comply with Merlin's Fraud Policy and Merlin conducts due diligence before establishing joint ventures and/or engaging consultants, contractors and suppliers. The application of the policy is underpinned by an ongoing employee training regime that provides a record of responses to a series of questions to demonstrate that a user has understood the policy and its application.
• Retail Merchandiser Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct and Global Sourcing Principles establish the standards for commercial suppliers working for Merlin. As business relationships develop, we expect suppliers to comply with internationally recognised codes of practice on Human Rights, employment practices and working conditions. These documents specifically require suppliers to achieve and maintain standards in relation to the following:
Prevention of child labour; Prevention of forced labour; Prevention of slave and trafficked labour; Ensuring safety; Health and hygiene;

Associations, discrimination and coercion; Working hours and wages; and Protection of the environment.
Suppliers
Our supply chains include local, national and international partners and the Company will not knowingly do business with parties who violate applicable laws and regulations, including local, environmental and employment laws.
Suppliers are required to sign as a condition of doing business, Merlin Entertainments’ standard conditions of purchase for goods and services which contain our Ethical Dealing Principles. Our Ethical Dealing Principles require suppliers to be compliant with international conventions in relation to forced labour; freedom of association; right to organise and collective bargaining; equal remuneration; abolition of forced labour; discrimination; minimum age and child labour; the European Convention on Human Rights and European Money Laundering Convention. When signing our standard terms and conditions for commercial activity, suppliers also agree to adhere to the Retail Merchandise Code of Conduct.
The Company has several systems in place to identify and assess potential risks in our supply chain, mitigate these risks and protect whistle-blowers. These include:
requiring commercial suppliers to comply with our Human Rights Policy and Retail Merchandise Code of Conduct through signing the Merlin Entertainments standard terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services. binding suppliers to ethical dealing clauses in all contract terms and conditions; holding regular review meetings with all major commercial suppliers and brand partners which focus on the delivery of goods and services in line with the terms of our agreement; Merlin has a team within its retail buying group dedicated to ensuring compliance within areas of supply that are deemed 'high risk'. 'High risk' commercial suppliers that produce Merlin Entertainments branded products are independently audited against the Merlin Social Audit Report to ensure continued compliance against our standards; where factories fall beneath the required standards, corrective action plans are created and timescales for improvements agreed. A second audit will follow to ensure agreed standards are then being met. Failure of a second audit will automatically delist the supplier; invoking strict sanctions on suppliers who do not meet our performance expectations or uphold the terms of our agreement. For example, any evidence of child labour results in the immediate delisting of a supplier, as does failure of two audit results; use of an independent externally hosted Whistleblowing Hotline which all employees, workers and contractors are made aware of upon induction and encouraged to use whenever appropriate. This is commissioned by the Company's Audit Committee which receives regular reports.
In addition to the above, where the Company procures outsourced labour services, such as food and beverage, housekeeping and cleaning, it will only work with formal labour providers which are legitimate, registered business entities. It will only enter into a contract arrangement where a clear Service Level Agreement is in place and after due diligence of the supplier’s management systems and agency worker documentation has been completed. This is supported throughout the term of the agreement through direct checks with the third party staff by Merlin management to ensure the ethical treatment of workers in line with Merlin’s own standards.
In 2017, Merlin commissioned an independent review of its housekeeping services at Alton Towers Resort UK. No instances of modern slavery were identified, however Merlin has adopted additional risk assessment practices from the process in its future assessments of third party housekeeping providers. Merlin will continue to seek further enhancements to its operating procedures in evaluating its supply chain based on the emergence of best practice.
Training
All staff involved in the procurement of goods and services understand the detail of our Merlin Ethical Dealing Principles, which form part of our contractual terms and conditions of supply, in addition to the policies and procedures that underpin monitoring and compliance. Merlin’s induction programme is tailored

to incorporate the Employee Code of Conduct and the relevant policies relating to specific roles.
Every year, all employees that may be exposed to the risk of bribery or fraud as part of their duties complete training vis-à-vis the UK Bribery Act. In support of the child and young workers protection policy, all managers and employees who are discharging responsibilities that involve children or young adults, including employees, attend regular safeguarding and awareness training. Specially trained Designated Safeguarding Officers are at hand to enforce the safeguarding policy and support the administering of training.
As our business expands, we are mindful of the increased risks relating to modern slavery associated with new market entry and high volume employment sectors such as accommodation and food and beverage operations. We ensure we abide by all local labour laws and that the policies that relate to modern slavery are an essential part of any induction programme.
Effectiveness / Performance Review
The Company understands that modern slavery risk is continually evolving, and will remain vigilant to slavery and human trafficking in its supply chains. We will always comply with local legislation and adopt global standards in the way we work with our people and our suppliers. We continue to monitor the performance of our measures to detect and prevent modern slavery in our supply chains.
In particular, we are taking steps to:
ensure we are alert to any new supplier and undertake the requisite above actions to negate any risk associated with slavery or trafficking; extend our risk profiling beyond centralised commercial suppliers, categorising risk levels within the supplier base based on territory, product type or service; and enhance training and awareness specific to modern slavery given to all staff involved in managing the supply chain, leveraging the development of Merlin’s global HR platform, ‘The People Portal’.
Merlin will always seek to do the right thing by its employee and its communities and operates within a framework of continuous self-assessment and improvement.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2018. This is a Group statement which also covers the subsidiaries that apply to the disclosure criteria of the Act, namely Merlin Attractions Operations Limited and Merlin Entertainments (SEA LIFE) Limited. It has been approved by the Board of Directors of Merlin Entertainments plc.

67,"Modern Slavery Statement 17/18
Introduction
This is Dixons Carphone plc's (the ‘Company’) third statement on slavery and human trafficking and is made pursuant to section 54(6) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ‘Act’). It constitutes the Group’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 28 April 2018. Our Board fully supports the aims of the Act and is committed to combatting the risk of slavery and human trafficking (‘Modern Slavery’) in our business and supply chains. In the past twelve months, we have completed a due diligence exercise on our business and suppliers and have begun the process of identifying those more at risk from Modern Slavery by sending them a questionnaire on workers’ rights which provides them with a risk rating. Our Modern Slavery Policy, which can be found here has been introduced to colleagues, suppliers, agents and partners of our UK & Ireland business and we are in the process of delivering this to the Nordics and Greek businesses and our firsttier suppliers worldwide. We are pleased to become the first non-food retailer to join the Bright Future programme, giving victims of slavery, here in the UK, a pathway to paid employment and reintegration into society. We are also the first retailer to join the Slave Free Alliance a best practice minimum standard and an anti-slavery 'mark' that demonstrates a positive, ethical statement of commitment. Our dedicated team will continue to build on what we have achieved; making improvements and raising awareness of Modern Slavery within our business and our supply chain.
Structure, Business and Supply Chains
We are one of Europe's leading specialist electrical and telecommunications retailer and services company, employing over 42,000 people in 9 countries. We offer a comprehensive range of electronic and mobile products, connectivity and expert after-sales services. The organisation is divided into a number of subsidiaries, full details of which are published on our website. The Company has two main divisions: Group (including UK & Ireland) and International (including Nordics and Greece). Our businesses in the UK & Ireland, the Nordics and Greece are supported by their own support centre (head office) and distribution network with each procuring goods for resale (i.e. products to be sold in our stores) and goods not for resale (i.e. service providers such as catering and cleaning, construction services, IT partners, etc.). As well as buying goods from many leading brands, our OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) operation, based in Hong Kong, sources many product types that are sold in our stores under our own or licenced brand names from 113 suppliers in the Far East and Europe. This part of our operation is well established and has been actively engaging in ethical auditing / risk assessment for many years; we have utilised that knowledge and experience when creating our Modern Slavery team and understanding our wider business and supply chain. We are aware that some of the products we sell or the services we procure carry a higher risk of Modern Slavery, either due to the location where they are manufactured, the raw materials that they contain, or the engagement of labour providers, sub-contractors and similar. Last year we acknowledged that, over time, we needed to develop effective methods of communication and collaboration with our suppliers to better understand what happens further down our supply chains, working together to resolve any issues that we may encounter. We have begun this ongoing process and we will look to build year on year.
Policies in Relation to Slavery & Human Trafficking
Our Modern Slavery policy which was created last year has now been issued to our colleagues in the UK & Ireland and we will be issuing to HK, Nordics and Greece by the end of 2018. Our suppliers to our UK & Ireland business have been

issued the policy and we are asking them to confirm they have read and will abide by it. The Company also has an Ethical Sourcing Policy, reflecting our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We require our OEM suppliers to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place and we will look to expand that to other areas of our supply chain in the coming year. Our Modern Slavery and Ethical Sourcing policies consider the Social Accountability 8000 standard, ETI Base Code, FTSE4Good criteria and the UN Guiding Principles, as well as guidance from various other subject matter experts. We will continue to review our existing policies for recruitment, procurement, whistleblowing, etc. and where necessary make changes or introduce explicit references to Modern Slavery. We will also look to introduce new policies as and when relevant, and as our understanding of the issues and the approaches we need to take improve.
Due Diligence Process
Our social and ethical auditing team carries out comprehensive due diligence of suppliers of our OEM products prior to selection against strict trading terms and operating procedures. Approved suppliers are then subject to regular checks and audits. We will expand this procedure to relevant parts of our supply chain once we have analysed the results of our workers’ rights questionnaire. Where necessary, we will introduce reporting to monitor and evaluate risk at any given time. Once complete, the questionnaire will have been sent to approximately 13,000 suppliers globally; our first-tier suppliers in their entirety. The responses received will allow us to assess actual and potential human rights impacts and act upon the findings in an appropriate manner. The questionnaire asks questions in relation to the countries where our suppliers operate, the types of goods and / or services they provide (to us and to others), the types of workers they employ and the way they might treat them (wages, working hours, freedom of movement, the rights of young employees, etc.). We also ask if they must produce their own Modern Slavery statement (and if so, to provide us with a copy) and what policies and procedures they have in place to ensure their business and supply chains are free from Modern Slavery as well as the steps they take to protect workers’ rights in general. We have in place a confidential (and anonymous, should the caller so choose) whistleblowing helpline and this is referred to in our Modern Slavery Policy. The helpline allows anyone within our supply chain to raise concerns without fear of being harassed or bullied, losing out on opportunities or training, or facing demotion or dismissal, as a consequence of raising their concerns. Over the next 12 months we will work with the Slave Free Alliance to audit our processes and make appropriate improvements.
Risk Assessment and Management
Now we have completed the mapping of our supply chain we will be able to overlay the results of our workers’ rights questionnaire. This will help us to identify higher risk areas to target process and resources effectively. As members of the Slave Free Alliance we will be able to utilise their experience to go beyond compliance and audits within our business and supply chain. Aside from the risk assessment and questionnaire, we have played an active part in the Modern Slavery and Ethical Sourcing groups at the British Retail Consortium, are members of SEDEX and regularly attend events where there is an opportunity to discuss the risks of Modern Slavery with our peers, Non-Governmental Organisations (‘NGOs’) and other relevant stakeholders. This helps to expand our knowledge and highlight countries, product types or services that may be considered to have a higher risk of Modern Slavery. The knowledge and experience that we have obtained will help us identify the risks and issues, assess the level of importance and develop appropriate remedies. We will continue to collaborate and improve our understanding as time goes on. Through this collaboration we have already identified one key area of risk here in the UK - distribution and worked to reduce that risk. We have engaged with our distribution and recruitment partners, working to understand how they are mitigating risk and the steps that are taking to ensure that workers’ rights are upheld. We will continue dialogue and offer ongoing support to suppliers. We will also look to develop a written operating procedure to follow in the event of finding a victim of modern slavery. Victims safety is paramount and we shall support them appropriately.
Monitoring
The effectiveness of our work on Modern Slavery will continue to improve over time. We currently have the following measures in place:
Addressing non-compliance in relation to our OEM supplier factory audits: Our audits include several topics including

child / young labour, working hours, wages and deductions, overtime, working conditions and safety, freedom of movement and association, discrimination and disciplinary practices. Each factory is audited prior to selection. Once suppliers have been approved, they remain subject to regular checks and audits. These supplier audits are carried out with a view to assisting them in improving their working practices and we work with factories where failures have been identified. Wherever we can, we work with the supplier to make improvements; where this is not possible or no improvements are made, they will not be approved as a supplier, or will be delisted as appropriate; The number of calls to our Whistleblowing hotline that are related to ethical issues (including all forms of Modern Slavery); and The responses (or lack thereof) received from the questionnaire sent to our suppliers.
Training
Our OEM auditing teams in Hong Kong and mainland China receive comprehensive training in relation to conducting ethical audits and identifying issues. We are developing training for other colleagues within our business and have begun with our management population in distribution and our colleagues that deal with recruitment, either directly or through agencies. Training will be tailored to specific high-risk areas identified through the risk mapping and questionnaire and we will focus on the parts of our business and supply chain carrying higher risk. Our experience and the knowledge of third party organisations, such as Hope for Justice, that are experts in this field will help us decide which types of business and which countries are highest risk. It is important that every one of our colleagues and suppliers understands what Modern Slavery is and how they can escalate any concerns.
Further Steps
We will continue in 2018/19 to build on the progress we have made this year. Our risk assessment of suppliers will continue and the data obtained from the questionnaire will identify areas of focus for this year and beyond. We will continue to improve communication on this topic with our supply chain and welcome opportunities to collaborate to identify risks or solve problems that we cannot tackle alone. We will face common issues and by working together, not only with suppliers but also with other companies, we will be far more effective in meeting our common goal of eradicating Modern Slavery. We are currently in dialogue with other retailers/NGOs to develop a standardised protocol to deal with reported cases of Modern Slavery and will continue to develop our relationships with Bright Future, the Slave Free Alliance and other potential partners in this area. This statement has been approved by the Dixons Carphone plc Board of Directors. A new statement will be published each year on the corporate website at www.dixonscarphone.com.

Slavery and Human trafficking statement (“Statement”) as required under s54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2017
(“Financial Year”)
Introduction
London Stock Exchange Group plc and its subsidiaries (“LSEG”/”us”/ “we”/”our”/the “Group”) is committed to ensuring that all of its business dealings are carried out in full compliance with relevant laws and, in doing so we endorse the implementation and promotion of ethical business practices. LSEG is committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and trafficking and we have taken significant steps during the Financial Year to promote and improve our supply chain management and procurement processes and procedures.
This Statement covers all the companies belonging directly or indirectly to the LSEG, including: London Stock Exchange plc, LCH Group Limited, LCH Limited, FTSE International Limited, Turquoise Global Holdings Limited, LSEG Business Services Limited, LSEG Employment Services Limited, LSEGH, Inc. Borsa Italiana S.p.A., MTS S.p.A., Monte Titoli S.p.A., Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia S.p.A., LCH S.A. and Frank Russell Company.

The Group engages with a wide range of third party suppliers.

A significant proportion of the Group’s total third party spend is concentrated within Professional Services (for example specialist consultancy, legal and advisory firms) and Technology (for example supply of physical IT goods, and provision of IT-related services).
Policies and contractual controls
LSEG internal policies include our Supplier Code of Conduct, Employee Code of Conduct and Recruitment/Agency policies where we confirm that we will not tolerate or condone abuse of human rights within any part of our business or supply chains.
During 2017 LSEG has amended its standard supplier framework terms to specifically address modern slavery and human trafficking and any requests to deviate from the standard form wording would trigger a legal review.
Whistleblowing policy
We also operate a Whistleblowing Policy, aimed principally at our employees but also available to others working in our supply chains and encourage employees, customers and other business partners to report any concerns relating to direct activities, supply chains or any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. LSEG’s whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for individuals to make disclosures without fear of retaliation and individuals can use our confidential helpline and/or confidential disclosure form to escalate potential issues.
Assessment and management of Modern Slavery Risk within our business and supply chains
Generally speaking, LSEG operates within an industry where the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking is deemed to be low, based on the nature of the products and the services consumedas well as the location of significant operations; nevertheless LSEG recognises the prevalence of modern slavery and human trafficking and the importance of taking the necessary steps to combat them.
In 2016, our procurement team undertook a broad review of the existing supplier base, focusing on the suppliers that made up the top 75% of spend and using the guidance published by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (“CIPS”). On the basis of this analysis, we have categorised these suppliers low, medium or high risk from a modern slavery and human trafficking perspective.

17 suppliers (out of 259 risk assessed) were identified as medium risk, the remainder as low risk. These suppliers are the Group’s main suppliers of Facilities Management services (premises/mechanical and electrical maintenance, cleaning and security), Corporate Services (catering and hospitality services) and Construction / Office Fit Out related services. High spend Professional Services and Technology Services providers were deemed low risk based on the published slavery and trafficking guidance. No high risk suppliers have been identified.
For all medium risk suppliers the procurement team has committed to sending out the Supplier Code of Conduct (where they have not done it already) or asking the supplier to evidence their equivalent code that specifically addresses modern slavery and human trafficking. We recognise that spend and risk are not inextricably linked but believe that this has provided a firm foundation to be built on in future years.
A separate exercise was completed in 2017 to perform due diligence on the third party suppliers who were deemed to be most critical to ongoing Group operations, based a number of different factors including support to business resilience, recovery and provision of critical infrastructure or services. This included agreement to the Group’s Supplier Code of Conduct by a number of critical technology products, services and professional services suppliers.
Additionally our procurement team (working closely with our central compliance team) has developed a risk segmentation process to assess the risk of all new suppliers (“Risk Segmentation Process”) and we have documented evolving best practice in this area and cascaded it down through the organisation.
The Risk Segmentation Process has evolved over time to align with relevant regulatory, legal and best practice standards. The Risk Segmentation Process now includes assessment of geographic risk of a potential third party supplier (from the perspective of financial crime, money laundering, sanctions and corruption) and identification of where there may be elevated risk through the activity of a third party acting as an agent, business intermediary or lobbyist. This in turn leads to the requirement for enhanced due diligence on the ultimate beneficial owners of those third parties in addition to the third parties themselves.
The Group’s approach to managing and mitigating slavery and trafficking risk incorporates a number of techniques at different stages of an engagement with its supply chain: risk assessment and due diligence prior to supplier on-boarding; inclusion, where possible, of a cross-jurisdictional anti-slavery and trafficking clause into supplier contracts to ensure, as far as possible, that our suppliers are contractually bound to comply with the terms of the Act; and due diligence repeated annually for suppliers assessed as more critical to the Group’s operations. This approach requires, at various stages, the collective involvement and acceptance of Procurement, Legal, Risk and Compliance and other relevant subject matter experts from across the Group.
The results of risk assessment, appropriate due diligence, any residual risk mitigating actions and confirmation of adoption of Group contract standards (including slavery and human trafficking clauses) require risk acceptance and signoff by an appropriate accountable executive prior to signature of supplier contracts.
The proportion of the supply base who have agreed to our Supplier Code of Conduct is measured and reported to relevant executive committees on a periodic basis, as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of compliance to Group standards.
Due Diligence

In order to mitigate risk, LSEG, through provision of Group-wide policies, frameworks, tools, processes and guidance from its Group Procurement and other SME functions, undertakes extensive due diligence on its business and when considering taking on new suppliers. Under these policies and frameworks LSEG also reviews all Tier 1 (“Critical” Suppliers) on at least an annual basis, working closely with the business owners who have day to day interaction with these suppliers.
The types of review activities include but are not limited to:
1. Completing the Group’s Risk Segmentation Form, which determines the level of risk associated with the new supplier and any subsequent due diligence activity that needs to take place prior to engaging with the supplier. The risk segmentation form covers areas including, but not limited to: Business Continuity Management, Information/Cyber Security, geographic risk, anticipated length of contract, KYC/KYB checks, financial health screening. Agreement to the Group Supplier Code of Conduct, sanctions and PEPs screening of the supplier are a minimum due diligence requirement for all suppliers.
2. If a supplier is deemed to be strategic, high risk or critical in any of the above areas, or where elevated KYC/KYB risk is identified, additional in depth due diligence will be conducted. LSEG has a range of best practice tools and systems to help with these activities, as well as questionnaires produced by subject matter experts for assurance purposes.
3. Another part of the due diligence exercise is to send LSEG’s Supplier Code of Conduct to all in scope prospective suppliers for their review and agreement in advance of being on-boarded. It is acceptable for the supplier to provide their own Code of Conduct as an equivalent, providing that it is materially the same as the Group’s. Group Procurement will conduct this comparison and will challenge the supplier if there is no reference made to modern slavery, human rights or other key components, in order to clarify their formal stance on the relevant area. If there are residual concerns, our procurement team can escalate to the Compliance function for further review.
4. Guidance on the above is held centrally on internal sites, to ensure consistency across the Group and adherence to LSEG’s Group Procurement policy. Group Procurement, Risk and Compliance act as points of reference for the rest of the business, providing expertise and guidance on any queries.
Training
In relevant functions across the Group, e.g. Group Procurement, where staff are more likely to be in a position to identify potential issues relating to Modern Slavery and human rights given their day to day operations, additional training has been provided. This covered how to conduct a risk assessment across the supplier base, as well as the red flag identification system.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our Group’ slavery and human trafficking statement for the Financial year ended 31 December 2017.
This Statement has been approved by the Board of Directors of the London Stock Exchange Group plc in its meeting of March 1st , 2018.

Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement
VIACOM'S STATEMENT ON COUNTERING SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
This statement is intended to confirm and record Viacom's strong stance against slavery and human trafficking. It has been approved by the board of each of Viacom Camden Lock Limited, Paramount British Pictures Limited, Nickelodeon Huggings U.K. Limited, Nickelodeon UK Holdings LLC and MTV Networks Europe on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries that carry on business in the UK for the financial year ending 30 September 2016.
OUR ORGANISATION
Viacom is home to premier global media brands that create compelling television programs, motion pictures, short-form content, apps, games, consumer products, social media experiences, and other entertainment content for audiences in more than 180 countries. Viacom's media networks, including Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, Spike, BET, CMT, TV Land, Nick at Nite, Nick Jr., Logo, Nicktoons, TeenNick, Channel 5 (UK), Telefe (Argentina) and Paramount Channel, reach over 3.9 billion cumulative television subscribers worldwide. Paramount Pictures is a major global producer and distributor of filmed entertainment.
OUR VALUES
Viacom strives to maintain throughout its global operations the highest standards of business ethics, and is committed to legal compliance and ethical business practices in all of its operations worldwide.
COUNTERING THE RISK OF SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Viacom recognises that modern slavery may exist to a greater or lesser extent in most, if not all, countries and in most industries. Given the number of countries in which Viacom operates, we are aware of the need to address the risk of modern slavery arising in our supply chains. This statement sets out the steps we are taking in this regard (and is intended to meet the requirements of the UK's Modern Slavery Act 2015).
Viacom's core business is in the production and distribution of media content, including film and television. For this reason, our business and that of most of our suppliers operate in areas where the roles being performed are largely technical and/or professional, and the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking is low.
Viacom nonetheless takes a zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking. We are not aware of, nor do we have any information to suggest that, any inappropriate labour conditions are present in our supply chains. We apply strict and consistent standards when dealing with suppliers around the world.
OUR ACTIONS
To ensure that all of our suppliers adopt the same high values as we do, Viacom has in place a compliance programme consisting of a Supplier Compliance Policy. Under the provisions of the Policy our suppliers must adhere to the same high standards that Viacom sets itself in relation to fair and ethical employment practices. This includes practices relating to wages, hours, overtime and benefits, and health, safety and the environment and those combating improper discrimination and child and forced labour.
In accordance with our zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking, Viacom will immediately investigate any report or allegation involving wrongdoing of this nature and take remedial actions as appropriate.

SHEPHERD NEAME - MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT
This statement sets out the steps that Shepherd Neame has taken during our financial year to ensure that modern day slavery and human trafficking is not occurring in our organisation or in our supply chains. This statement will be reviewed annually.
The Company acknowledges responsibility to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the relating definitions set out within.
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND ACTIVITIES
Shepherd Neame is an independent family business and Britain’s oldest brewer.
Our core business is built around brewing and packaging of beer and a provider of Public House and Hotel facilities. Our operations are predominantly located in the South-East of England and current turnover is in excess of £36 million.
The business is organised into three business units: Managed Pubs and Hotels, Tenancy and Licensed properties and Brewing & Brands.
We maintain many relationships with different organisations in our supply chain, as well as directly employing approx. 1,300 employees throughout the business (@ April 2016).
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
With regard to employment law, human rights and including the Modern Slavery Act 2015, we will continually review our existing compliance and risk management process. This will determine associated risk, detection and prevention of modern day slavery and human trafficking within our supply chain for products and services to the organisation.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS
As part of the company’s due diligence process into slavery and human trafficking the supplier approval process will incorporate:
• A regular Ethical Audit review of controls of all our suppliers and an established process of supplier approval. • Whilst our supply chain is predominantly UK and EU based and we would expect these entities to have applicable
anti-slavery and human trafficking policies and procedures, we do import a small percentage of products and services from sources outside the UK and EU. These may potentially operate with an increased risk for slavery and human trafficking issues. The management control of these suppliers will be continually monitored. • The business will not forge commercial relationships with any business knowingly involved with slavery or human trafficking. • We will expect all who have, or seek a commercial relationship to familiarise themselves with The Modern Slavery Act and our anti-slavery values and act consistently within these. • We have in place systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistle blowers. • We work in partnership with the Gangmasters Licensing Authority to protect vulnerable and exploited workers. • We will continue to work with the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and work in partnership to continuously improve our audit procedures and results.
EFFECTIVENESS AND COMMUNICATION
Using key performance indicators to effectively measure the effectiveness of our policy we will:
• Complete regular audits of our supply chain (questionnaires/ personal contact) to ascertain their understanding, compliance and set standard expectations.
• We will undertake Agency Worker employment audits on a yearly basis. • We audit employment agencies within the Gangmasters Licensing Authority guidelines to protect vulnerable and
exploited workers. • We will provide training to relevant members of staff

• Our Directors will champion its understanding and implementation within the business and ensure Shepherd Neame is compliant with our policy.
• We will communicate and work in partnership with our recognised Trade Union group to capture additional channels of communication to their membership, regarding the importance, implementation and management of suppliers under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
OUR POLICY ON MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Our attitude to modern slavery and human trafficking is zero tolerance and we expect all those in our supply chain to comply with our values.
If a supplier is found to be demonstrating unacceptable practices they will be investigated and provided with guidance regarding immediate required improvements.
If no improvement is implemented or they indicate an unwillingness to cease unacceptable practices they will be reported to the appropriate authorities and ultimately trading with this supplier would cease.
Company policies assist the organisation to assess, prevent and mitigate the risk of modern slavery existing in the organisation and its supply chains. These include:
• Modern Slavery policy • Purchasing Policy • Grievance policy • Whistle-blowing policy
APPROVAL
This statement has been approved by the company’s board of directors.
Name: R.N Duncan
Position: Company Secretary and Head of Human Resources.

73,"Modern slavery interim statement 2019
Introduction
Modern slavery and human trafficking are abhorrent practices that still exist in many parts of the world, including the UK.
This statement is designed to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within any part of Legal & General Group Plc, all our subsidiaries and within all our supply chains.
These disclosures are on top of the high standards by which we operate our own business including being a Living Wage Employer, a signatory to the UN Global Compact and having a long term partnership agreement with Unite the Union, all designed to make sure that our own employees are well supported.
We will not tolerate any form of slavery or servitude in our business or supply chains and understand our duty to respect human rights. Our supplier selection and governance policies and processes ensure we deal with robust and credible suppliers and partners who share similar values and principles.
This is our second statement on our efforts to prevent modern slavery in line with Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and details the steps taken to help prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business operations and supply chains. This is an interim statement which will be expanded and updated for our March 2020 full-year results. Our previous statement is available at:
https://www.legalandgeneralgroup.com/csr/modern-slavery-statement/modern-slavery-2017statement/
This statement has been approved on behalf of the Legal & General Group Board and will be submitted for further ratification at a future Board meeting.

Key facts
• We have 8,000 employees • We have over 10 million customers • Total assets under management were £1.15 trillion at 30.06.19 • 2018 pre-tax profits of £2.102 billion
Our higher-risk businesses
The areas of our business that we have identified as being at higher-risk to modern slavery practices are:
 Procurement of materials  The use of contract labour  Recruitment of staff  House building  IT services
We have in place a wide range of processes and controls to prevent modern slavery from entering into our workplace. These include right-to-work checks, real living wages, a strong union relationship and focussed training. Legal & General Homes have modern slavery questionnaires for contractors and sub-contractors.
For example, our homes business has a number of measures in place covering the direct employment of staff; the indirect employment of staff, such as Security and IT; supply chain services and service contracts, supply chain materials and supply chain construction contracts. These cover areas such as anti-bribery and corruption, whistle-blower policies, real living wage requirements and supplier codes of conduct.
Our supply chains
• Our UK direct supply chain is predominantly UK procured with categories such as some IT support and software development delivered from overseas as well as construction materials and supplies etc.
• We’re a major commercial property landlord via Legal & General Real Assets who manage our commercial property portfolio. We have responsibility for services such as security, cleaning and catering as well as sourcing these services for our own office environments.
• We are a top 10 UK house builder with construction and manufacturing services, including construction labour.
Our group procurement supplier code of conduct
Our group procurement supplier code of conduct sets out various principles that suppliers are required to sign up to as part of the sourcing and on-boarding processes.
The document sets out key principles and minimum standards on topics such as:
3

1. Protecting the environment 2. Protecting the employee 3. A safe and healthy workplace 4. Equality, Diversity, Inclusion and Ethics 5. Community Involvement. 6. Meeting our Customers’ needs

https://www.legalandgeneralgroup.com/media/2881/suppliercodeofconduct2019.pdf
Our supplier code of conduct regarding modern slavery
Working with industry experts and our key suppliers we have developed a number of indicators, questions and conversations we are starting to ask suppliers in relation to their direction of working standards and quality jobs. These are being integrated into our supplier code of conduct and our new digital tools that are being deployed as well as some direct engagement with key suppliers to start to gather data.
Typical questions we have asked our suppliers about external standards of operation include:
1. Are you a signatory to the Living Wage Foundation? 2. Are you fully compliant with the UK Agency Worker Regulation Standards? 3. Are you signed up to the 'Swedish derogation model' of operating? 4. What is your HMRC risk rating for the past three years?
Trend data that is starting to be collected from certain key suppliers by our Group Procurement team and will be collected more widely through our new digital tools:-
1. CEO to average worker pay ratio (excluding bonuses) for whole business 2. Permanent to Temp / Contractor ratio working on Legal & General
contracts over the past 12 months. 3. Migrant to non-migrant workers ratio working on Legal & General contracts
over the past 12 months. 4. Percentage of workforce getting paid on time every week over past 12
months.
Risk Assessment and management
We asked Anti-Slavery International to run workshops to help us really understand how slavery plays out in a UK context and how we would practically spot signs of slavery day-in, day-out when working with our suppliers.
We have also recently invested in new digital Procurement and SRM tools which will provide more accountability and transparency across our supply chain as well as enhancing our supplier financial testing capability to ensure we continue to deal with robust and professional firms.
4

The new digital tools will provide more MI and data on our supply base as well as enabling the Supplier Relationship Managers to target their efforts on the most pertinent areas of risk and spend. This is also backed up structured reviews with key suppliers and site visits where applicable. As part of our drive to eliminate Modern Slavery in our supply chain, our central Group Procurement function chairs a quarterly group wide CSR forum which discusses Modern slavery risk as well as running workshops with higher risk business units to best address this topic. In order to test ourselves further and look for opportunities to further tighten controls and better address risk in key areas we have also engaged with Stronger2gether to carry out a thorough group wide audit of modern slavery risk to help us better plan and resource accordingly on this important topic going forward.
Training
Our Modern Slavery training is currently targeted to our higher-risk areas such as construction and house building. For example, our CALA Homes business has in place a computer-based training for all relevant employees. Our aim is to provide a level of consistent modern slavery training for all employees across the group, with more focused training in higher-risk areas as required.

CDC Group plc, the UK’s development finance institution, is wholly owned by the UK Government. Our mission is to support the building of businesses throughout Africa and South Asia, to create jobs and to make a lasting difference to people's lives in some of the world's poorest places.
We aim to invest where our job creation focus can have the greatest impact: in countries where the private sector is weak, and jobs are scarce, and in sectors where growth leads to jobs – directly and indirectly – such as infrastructure, food and agriculture, construction, education, health, financial institutions and manufacturing.
Our portfolio of investments is valued at £4.3 billion and includes 1,229 investee companies. Our current strategy means that we will invest only in Africa and South Asia (where over 70 per cent of the world's poorest people live), although we also have a declining portfolio of legacy investments in China, South East Asia, and Latin America.
We invest directly (through equity, debt and other instruments) and indirectly through fund managers who are aligned with us and invest our capital in businesses for us. Central to our ethos is a firm commitment to responsible investment. The businesses we support are required to adhere to The CDC Code of Responsible Investing (The Code), which stipulates environmental, social, labour and governance standards that often exceed those required by local law. The Code includes requirements on working conditions, labour rights and access to remedy, and was updated in 2017 to include specific reference to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the MSA).
Assessing risks of Modern Slavery
We recognise that there are risks of linkage to Modern Slavery in our own operations and via the investments we make. Evidence from our markets suggests that we need to pay particular attention to these risks where our investees rely on third party contractors and supply chains in

a range of industry sectors and geographies where there is evidence of elevated risks from Modern Slavery.
Our investments
Policies relating to Modern Slavery in our investments The Code applies to every investment we make, and it sets out our labour practice requirements for the businesses we support. These requirements include commitments to comply with the International Labour Organization’s Core Labour Conventions 29 (Forced Labour) and 105 (Abolition of Forced Labour) as well as applicable labour laws and regulations in the countries where we invest.
Assessing risks of Modern Slavery in our investments We undertake environmental and social due diligence (ESDD) on all our investments using The Code as our reference framework. When we invest directly (i.e. through debt or equity) in industry sectors or geographies where there are elevated risks of forced labour or other forms of Modern Slavery we focus specifically on these issues during ESDD. We often visit prospective investee businesses during our ESDD and conduct interviews with management and employees to understand the working practices of the businesses. The depth and focus of ESDD efforts (including specifically what focus will be given to assess the risk of Modern Slavery) as well as need to visit a prospective investee is decided at an early stage of our investment process (screening). For indirect investments (i.e. via funds), our ongoing programme of E&S Workshops for Fund Managers continues to focus on labour and employment practices (including Modern Slavery risks) and CDC’s ESG Toolkit for Fund Managers also provides online advice and guidance on Modern Slavery risks and management (particularly through the labour standards and human rights briefing notes). To provide further guidance to companies and investors operating in emerging markets CDC worked with DFID, IFC and EBRD to develop a Good Practice Note for the Private Sector on Managing Risks Associated with Modern Slavery which is a also available on CDC’s ESG Toolkit for Fund Managers.
Actively managing risks of Modern Slavery in our investments Because of the nature of CDC’s investments and the geographies where our capital is deployed, we may identify circumstances that indicate the occurrence of Modern Slavery (e.g. the retention of travel and identification documents). In some sectors (e.g. textiles, agribusiness and construction work) where investee businesses rely on complex supply chains, there are elevated risks of Modern Slavery (including indentured labour). If we identify or become aware of these risks, we require investee businesses to develop legally binding environmental and
Page 2 of 6

social action plans (ESAP) with specific commitments to address deficiencies over an agreed period, or where this cannot be assured (e.g. supply chains with limited leverage) work with the investee business to identify alternative sources of products. Our approach in such situations is to seek improvement.
If concerns arise during ESDD, CDC’s Environmental and Social (E&S) team assesses and monitors them via site visits, engagement with the management of prospective investee businesses and the review of ESDD documents, ESAPs and annual reports provided to CDC. In the event of Modern Slavery risks or deficiencies identified after the investment is made (as part of E&S monitoring), we address these through Corrective Action Plans (CAP) and active engagement with investees.
To enhance implementation practice, in March 2018, the CDC E&S team undertook training on labour standards and ILO core conventions, with a focus on implementation during ESDD and E&S monitoring.
Broader engagement on Modern Slavery CDC has presented and talked about its approach to Modern Slavery at a range of national and international meetings including the IFC Community of Learning (Sept 2018) and is involved in the Financial Sector Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.
Own operations
Our contract administration policy sets out our approach to managing Modern Slavery risks in our supply chain. Where deemed necessary on a risk-based approach, we require our contractors to comply with applicable employment laws and regulations, and specifically the MSA. Where suppliers provide services outside of the UK they are required to agree to our standard Modern Slavery compliance provisions or where appropriate, standards equivalent under international or relevant local law.
Every year we contact suppliers assessed as posing a potential Modern Slavery risk and require them to confirm that they comply with UK legislation, including labour laws and the MSA, and for suppliers providing services outside of the UK, equivalent international and local laws. For this period, we received confirmation from all the suppliers contacted that they are aware of the requirements of the MSA and that their labour practices conform with ILO Core Labour Conventions 29 and 105, as well as applicable legislation, including the MSA. Since 2018, for new contracts, or when an existing contract renews, the legal team ensures that, where there is
Page 3 of 6

the potential for a material risk of Modern Slavery, our standard Modern Slavery compliance provisions are included in the new contracts.

During the reporting year CDC provided refresher training to its internal legal team in assessing when to incorporate CDC’s standard modern slavery compliance provisions in its supplier contracts in cases where modern slavery risk may be foreseeable.

In 2019 CDC reviewed the definition of “contractor” in our contract administration policy to ensure it continues to fully address our risk-based approach to managing risks associated with modern slavery in our operations. We determined that our current definition captures our relevant suppliers and service providers across our business and across our locations.

Review of 2018 commitments

In our 2018 MSA Statement we made commitments to evolve our approaches and ability to manage Modern Slavery risks as follows:

Commitment Continue to assess whether any existing or potential service providers and suppliers to our new offices in Africa and South Asia pose any additional risks related to Modern Slavery and, through a due diligence questionnaire and appropriate contracting terms, take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, where applicable.
Update the information we make available to our staff on our whistleblowing policies, so it is clear how this relates to reporting suspicions of Modern Slavery.

Progress During this period, new contracts where we considered there was a potential for a material risk of Modern Slavery included the new standard Modern Slavery compliance provisions. All relevant suppliers were contacted to confirm their Modern Slavery declaration, all declarations were received for this period. As we continue to expand our offices internationally, a greater emphasis has been placed on implementation of our MSA commitments, and CDC’s facilities manager engages across offices around MSA commitments and monitors implementation. CDC’s whistleblowing policy was updated on 6th July 2018 to include specific mention of non-acceptance of exploitation or inappropriate treatment of third parties which includes persons who provide goods or services to CDC.

Page 4 of 6

Commitment Publish a good practice guide on assessing and managing risks of Modern Slavery with DFID and IFC.
Provide refresher training to our internal legal team on CDC’s approach to addressing the risk of Modern Slavery in its supply chain through incorporating our standard MSA compliance provisions into our supplier contracts.

Progress The Good Practice Guide on Managing Risks Associated with Modern Slavery was developed in partnership with DFID, EBRD, and IFC, and published in December 2018. After launch, dissemination initiatives were conducted, including presenting the guidance at conferences and events and delivering a free external webinar as part of IFC Sustainability series attended by over 250 participants. The standard compliance provisions were revised in 2018 to reflect compliance requirements wider than Modern Slavery. Refresher training to legal teams was provided in March 2019 covering CDC’s approach to ensure MSA compliance through the addition of such provisions into new and renewed supplier contracts.

2019 commitments

Over the next twelve months, we will: Continue to assess whether any existing or potential service providers and suppliers to our offices pose any additional risks related to Modern Slavery (through due diligence questionnaire, appropriate contracting terms, and direct engagement where needed) and take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, where applicable.

Disseminate internally CDCs policies, processes and approaches on Modern Slavery to support consistent implementation and awareness.

Continue to raise awareness on the importance of managing Modern Slavery risks and provide practical guidance to investees and fund managers to support implementation.

Provide internal training to operations and investment teams on CDC’s approach to addressing the risk of Modern Slavery throughout the investment process.

Modern Slavery Act Statement
Anti - Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the 2018 Financial Year
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps the Company has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our business.

Introduction from the Managing Director
Modern slavery is a crime resulting in an abhorrent abuse of the human rights of vulnerable workers. It can take various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking. The Company has a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and is committed to acting ethically and with integrity and transparency in all of its business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place anywhere within either its own business or in any of its supply chains, consistent with its obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
The Company also expects the same high standards from its suppliers, contractors and other business partners and, as part of its contracting processes, it includes specific prohibitions against the use of modern slavery, and expects that its suppliers will in turn hold their own suppliers to the same standards.
Slavery and human trafficking remains a hidden blight on our global society. We all have a responsibly to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. Staff are expected to report concerns and management are expected to act upon them.
Organisation’s Structure
The Sandown Group is a franchised Mercedes-Benz and smart dealer and retails and repairs Mercedes Benz and smart cars. In addition, the group retails vehicle parts and accessories as part of the Mercedes Benz UK network. The Sandown Group trades through two entities, namely, Sandown Surrey and Hampshire Limited and Sandown Dorset and Wiltshire Limited. The group has its head office in the UK and all trading outlets are in the UK. The group has an annual turnover in excess of £36m.

Our Business
Sandown is a privately owned Mercedes-Benz group operating across six sites. The group is responsible for two of Mercedes-Benz UK’s market areas and employs approximately 380 people.
Our Supply Chains
Our supply chains includes the sourcing of vehicles and parts relating to the sale and repair of new and used Mercedes and smart cars.
The automotive supply chain is one of the most complicated of any industry. There are often six to ten levels of suppliers between an automaker and the source of raw materials that enter the manufacturing process. The breadth, depth and interconnectedness of the automotive supply chain make it challenging to effectively manage business and sustainability issues. Respecting human rights and environmental issues in the supply chain is ultimately our suppliers’ responsibility. As customers, however, we play an active role in supplier development and have adopted various means to clearly communicate our expectations to our suppliers.
Our Policy on Human Slavery and Trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in any part of business or in our supply chains. Our Anti-slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing effective systems and controls to prevent slavery and human trafficking taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk –
We employ a professional Human Resources Team who vet all applicants thoroughly and work closely with any agencies and 3rd parties who provide us with labour. Where possible we build long standing relationships with our suppliers and and make clear our expectations of business behaviour. With regards to national or international supply chains, our point of contact is preferably with a UK company or branch and we expect these entities to have suitable anti-slavery and human trafficking policies and processes. We expect each entity in the chain to, at least, adopt ‘one-up’ due diligence on the next link in the chain. It is not practical for us (and every other participant in the chain) to have a direct relationship with all links in the chain, ultimately to component manufacturers. We have in place systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistle blowers. We have embraced the Stronger Together Programme across our sites, and applaud the work being done to reduce forced labour and human trafficking in the UK. Our Human Resources Team have been trained in the exploitation of human labour and we have provided training to key personnel within the business. All employees and agency staff have received information regarding the Stronger Together principles and have mechanisms to increase the visibility of issues, for example through confidentially contacting the Human Resources Team 01202 644 381 .
Supplier Adherence to our Values
We expect all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values.
The Directors and Senior Managers are responsible for compliance in their respective departments and for their supplier relationships.

Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to relevant members of staff. All Directors have been briefed on the subject.
Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking:
We use the following key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:
Completion of site audits by Senior Managers Use of labour monitoring and payroll systems Suppliers Compliance Principles are issued. All recruiters are briefed on issues around third party labour exploitation and have signed appropriate Compliance Principles Ensure that labour sourcing, recruitment and placement processes are under the control of trusted staff members and are not open to corruption. Do not use any individual or organisation to source and supply workers without being absolutely sure that workers are not being charged a work finding fee. Encourage workers to report cases of hidden third party labour exploitation and investigate and act on reports appropriately. This statement constitutes our group's slavery and human trafficking statement for the current financial year.

Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Transparency Statement 2020
INTRODUCTION
We recognize that modern slavery issues such as forced labor and human trafficking are a significant global issue. Credit Suisse Group AG (Group) is committed to taking actions to help ensure that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain or across our business.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54, Part 6 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act), with respect to the financial year ending December 31, 2019, and sets out the steps that we have taken to help ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking does not occur in our business operations or within our supply chain.
CREDIT SUISSE OVERVIEW
Credit Suisse is a leading wealth manager with strong investment banking capabilities. We serve our clients through three regionally focused divisions: Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific. These regional businesses are supported by two other divisions specializing in investment banking capabilities: Global Markets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets. Founded in 1856, we have today a global reach with operations in about 50 countries and more than 45,000 employees from over 150 different nations. More information can be found in our 2019 Annual Report. In the UK, Credit Suisse’s core activities include private banking, asset management and investment banking.
While our broad footprint helps us to generate a geographically balanced stream of revenues and to capture growth opportunities around the world, this potentially may expose us to the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking. To address this risk we have established procedures to prevent instances of modern slavery and human trafficking and require that our extensive range of suppliers and relevant third parties adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct.
This statement is made by the Group, Credit Suisse AG, the Group’s direct bank subsidiary and Credit Suisse entities that are subject to the requirements of section 54 of the Act1.
EXISTING COMMITMENTS
In its role as an employer, and as a user and provider of services, Credit Suisse is committed to human rights and respects them as a key element of responsible business conduct. Our approach to implement this within our operations is explained in the publicly accessible Credit Suisse Statement on Human Rights. This document forms the basis of Credit Suisse’s commitment to human rights. We strive to assume our responsibilities in the area of human rights in accordance with the International Bill of Human Rights, the corresponding principles on human and labor rights set out in the UN Global Compact as well as the eight fundamental International Labour Organization Conventions. This document also provides the basis for international human rights-related agreements that Credit Suisse has voluntarily pledged to uphold, including:
• Equator Principles • Principles for Responsible Investment
Credit Suisse aims to maintain a fair and professional working relationship with its suppliers and service providers. We consider factors like quality and shared values when forming such relationships and strive to work with those who conduct their businesses responsibly. In addition, we have developed a global framework to monitor these relationships. It is important for our business partners to know how our understanding of corporate responsibility affects them. The Group Supplier Code of Conduct, introduced in 2010, defines the standards relating to business integrity, codes of conduct and general business principles that Credit Suisse expects them to meet. The Supplier Code of Conduct aims to ensure that our external business partners, including their

employees, subsidiaries and subcontractors, respect human rights, labor rights, employment laws and environmental regulations. In particular, these companies pledge that they will not tolerate child labor or forced labor. Credit Suisse in the UK has been accredited as a Living Wage Employer since 2017. Credit Suisse is also a member of the Thun Group, an informal group that seeks to support the integration of the UN Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights into the policies and practices of financial services organisations. In addition, Credit Suisse is a member of the Wolfsberg Group, which aims to develop financial services industry standards for policies on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, which are often associated with modern slavery and human trafficking.
THIRD PARTY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
To manage financial, operational and reputational risks and to meet the increasing regulatory requirements governing business relationships with external third parties, Credit Suisse introduced the Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) Framework in 2016. Through TPRM, we assess potential environmental, social and labor law-related risks, among others, in connection with third party suppliers. The TPRM framework provides for structured due diligence assessments of our suppliers to identify where modern slavery and human trafficking risks may exist and also allows Credit Suisse to regularly monitor these relationships, to raise and track issues, and to therefore better understand the associated risks and, if necessary, demand actions for improvement from suppliers and service providers. Through TPRM, a reputational risk analysis is conducted through a database on all third parties according to their industry sector, location and adverse news coverage. Tags relating to topics such as human trafficking, child labor and forced labor are tracked.
If there are indications of potential modern slavery and human trafficking risks, enhanced due diligence is performed on the basis of information published by the third party, including material on the third party’s website, in its sustainability or corporate responsibility reports, or any regulatory filings. Additional information and the perspective of the respective third party can be obtained through direct interaction with the supplier in question.
If we were to become aware of a case of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within our direct supply chain, we would remediate any issues through our existing governance processes. Depending on the severity or in case a satisfactory remediation is not possible, the supplier relationship may ultimately be terminated.
Since launching TPRM we have subjected approximately 4,000 supplier relationships to a distinct risk review procedure. These relationships span different categories of technology, software, professional services, marketing, human resources and business services. Approximately 15% of the TPRM risk assessments relate to outsourcing relationships, where a third party vendor performs a function or activity on a recurring basis on behalf of Credit Suisse such as providing IT support services. The remaining risk assessments relate to non-outsourcing services such as market data services, consulting or the acquisition and maintenance of software licenses. No supplier has, to date, been terminated as a result of evidence of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring across our supply chain.
Additional supplier governance mechanisms have been introduced such as specific internal global committees, where vendorrelated risks including any issues related to human rights or modern slavery can be discussed and reviewed by senior leadership with representation from Compliance, General Counsel, Risk Management and other corporate functions.
Credit Suisse established a Vendor Management Office (VMO) in 2019 in an effort to better manage the overall value, risk and performance of our most critical vendor relationships. The VMO provides an additional framework to promote enhanced coordination and, as necessary, controls on vendor interactions and assess vendor performance across the bank. Over 75 vendors have been on-boarded to the VMO with a particular focus on outsourcing vendors and vendors providing critical services to the bank, encompassing over 3000 individual contracts.
In addition, we continue to review and enhance our supplier agreements as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the changing global regulatory environment and have added specific contractual clauses and supplier obligations relating to modern slavery and human trafficking to our external third party contract templates to facilitate compliance with the Act in our supplier agreements.

3/4
OUR POLICIES & TRAINING
Credit Suisse has a number of internal policies and controls which are relevant to ensure we help eradicate modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain or across our business, including when working with clients who we expect to share the same principled conduct. These policies relate to:
• reputational risk • sustainability management • third party management • reporting unusual incidents and misconduct (including whistleblowing) • global sourcing • undesirable clients • sanctions, sensitive countries/parties and Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of the Treasury (OFAC)
compliance.
Credit Suisse also examines aspects of client relationships or transactions that could be sensitive from a human rights perspective including modern slavery risks using a clearly defined, comprehensive risk review process. In 2019, 799 transactions or client relationships were assessed for potential environmental and social risks. This process is supported by our industry-specific sector policies and guidelines containing specific provisions that address human rights. For relationships with private clients, anti-money laundering regulations are applied.
All our employees are expected to comply with our internal policies and controls and complete annual mandatory training on a variety of subjects including Financial Crime Compliance, Operational Risk, Cybersecurity and Reporting Concerns at Work. Credit Suisse introduced new Conducts & Ethics training in 2017 which defines the way we do business and how we conduct ourselves in interactions with all of our internal and external stakeholders as an organisation. Moreover, substantial training and communications have been delivered with the launch of the TPRM framework and VMO and subsequent updates to ensure all relevant functions and employees, as well as third parties, are conversant with the new process and controls. In addition, the application and effectiveness of key processes and procedures of Credit Suisse are subjected to periodic internal audits. For example, an internal audit on the design and implementation of the TPRM framework was conducted in 2017, with follow-up actions completed in 2018. The results indicate that Credit Suisse has improved its ability to manage external vendor risk.
ONGOING PLANS
In the financial year leading up to the end of December 2020, we aim to continue developing and monitoring our TPRM processes and further evolve the existing due diligence questionnaires of our suppliers to confirm that our third parties and suppliers are not engaged in any modern slavery and human trafficking activities. For example, as part of our alignment with regulations on outsourcing and third party risk, such as the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) outsourcing and cloud regulations, we are looking to enhance our global TPRM Framework and extend due diligence checks on a number of areas including subcontractors to help instil more control and visibility as part of the ongoing improvements to our TPRM process. We are also considering plans to review our request for proposal (RFP) templates with specific questions on modern slavery and human trafficking as part of our efforts to ensure supplier alignment in our upfront sourcing process.
In response to the Act, we also plan to provide ongoing updates to the Sourcing & Vendor Management teams globally to enhance their awareness of the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chain.

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
Modern slavery and human trafficking are abhorrent practices that still exist in many parts of the world, including the UK. We welcome the UK Government’s introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the requirement on businesses to report on activities taken to combat slavery. Our vision is to be the most trusted retailer where people love to work and shop, which includes treating people fairly wherever they are in our business and supply chains. We understand our duty to respect human rights, are committed to identifying vulnerable workers and will not tolerate any form of slavery or servitude within our business or supply chain. We aim to ensure that a robust, risk-based approach will enable us to proactively tackle the serious exploitation of workers and direct resources to achieve maximum impact.
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out the steps taken by J Sainsbury plc during the year ending 11 March 2017 to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business operations and supply chains.

About Sainsbury’s Group Our commitment to helping customers live well for less has been at the heart of what we do since 1869. Today that means making our customers’ lives better and easier every day by offering great quality and service at fair prices – across food, clothing, general merchandise and financial services; whenever and wherever they want it.
As our customers’ lives change, so will our business. Sainsbury's acquired Home Retail Group (HRG), the owner of Argos and Habitat, on 2 September 2016, creating one of the UK’s leading food and non-food retailers. In this statement, Sainsbury’s refers to supermarkets and convenience stores selling Sainsbury’s branded food, groceries, clothing and general merchandise. Argos includes Argos stores, Argos digital stores in Sainsbury’s supermarkets and Habitat stores. Following our acquisition of HRG, we have begun work to develop an integrated approach and set of activities to address modern slavery for the new Sainsbury’s Group. As this work is still underway, the information on the following pages focuses on the activities of Sainsbury’s supermarkets. We are working to review targets and programmes across our business and will share further details in the coming year.
We are now a multi-product, multi-channel business with fast delivery networks. J Sainsbury plc operates over 2,200 stores in the UK and Ireland. This includes 605 supermarkets, 809 convenience stores, 59 Argos Digital stores in Sainsbury’s supermarkets and 11 Habitat stores – together with major online channels for food, clothing, general merchandise and financial services. We sell over 90,000 products and employ around 195,000 colleagues across the UK and Ireland.
Sainsbury’s Bank’s range of financial products includes credit cards, mortgages, savings and loans, as well as travel money and car, home, pet, travel and life insurance. We aim to offer Sainsbury’s shoppers great deals and rewards for choosing to bank with us. Our colleagues, strong culture and values are integral to achieving this vision and driving our success now and in the future.

Our supply chain We offer a wide range of products in our stores from fresh produce and household groceries through to clothes and homeware. We source our Sainsbury’s branded products from more than 2,000 supplier sites based in over 70 countries. The majority of our food is sourced from the UK and Europe, with over half of our suppliers based in the UK, followed by France, Spain and Italy. Our non-food products are mainly procured from China, followed by India, Turkey and Bangladesh. The range is further extended from furniture to electronics through Sainsbury’s Argos.
The complexity of each supply chain, the number of tiers, geographical spread and worker profiles vary considerably depending on the product. Our goods not for resale are sourced from more than 3,000 suppliers.

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
Policies and contractual terms We set out the expectations of our suppliers in relation to the treatment of workers through our Code of Conduct for Ethical Trade, our contractual terms, and the Sainsbury’s Supplier Handbook.
Sainsbury’s and Argos Codes of Conduct for Ethical Trade outline the standards our product suppliers must uphold on human rights in relation to their own employees and supply chains, including the strict prohibition of all forms of slavery and human trafficking. Our Code of Conduct is aligned with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code, which derives from the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organisation, and from the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Sainsbury’s direct suppliers are required to show compliance with this Code and to provide evidence of continuous improvement. They must also have in place their own Code of Conduct, policies and systems to manage ethical trade in their supply chains, and be able to report progress to us. Our policy includes guidance on the responsible use of labour providers and on conducting social compliance audits. Any suggestion of malpractice in our supply chain is investigated thoroughly and we do not tolerate any breaches of our ethical standards.
Recognising that excessive levels of worker indebtedness, caused by high recruitment fees, is one of the most common forms of modern slavery, we have committed to the Consumer Goods Forum’s (CGF) new Forced Labour Priority Industry Principles and are working, alongside other CGF members, to strive for zero recruitment fees in our business and supply chains, starting with our grocery supply chain.
At Sainsbury’s this year we amended our contractual terms with all direct grocery, clothing and general merchandise suppliers to include a clause on compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Suppliers are required to demonstrate this compliance and inform us of any breaches. Our Supplier Handbook for grocery suppliers outlines these requirements on modern slavery due diligence in more detail.
Our Sainsbury’s Colleague Handbook highlights our brand values and outlines the rights and responsibilities for our employees. We aim to be the

most inclusive retailer and create a working environment where everyone feels valued and respected and where colleagues can be the best they can be. We have a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation.
We also use an independent hotline, Sainsbury's RightLine, for colleagues, contractors and suppliers to report confidentially any issues of concern ranging from food safety to human rights and modern slavery.
Governance We established Sainsbury’s Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability (CR&S) Steering Group in 2001, and in 2007 we were one of the first FTSE 100 businesses to establish a non-executive board-level corporate responsibility committee. Our CR&S Committee provides oversight to the activities of our CR&S Steering Group. The Steering Group is chaired by our CEO, and comprises of senior directors, each responsible for one of our five values: sourcing with integrity, living healthier lives, respect for our environment, making a positive difference to our community and a great place to work. The programme of work for each of the values is managed through the cross-functional CR&S Steering Group, which meets twice annually and is chaired by the accountable senior director. Our Food Commercial Director is accountable for our sourcing with integrity value.
Our PLC Board oversees our Commercial Risk Map, which captures the principal risks to achieving Sainsbury’s business objectives, including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements such as the Modern Slavery Act.
In 2015, we established a cross-functional Modern Slavery Working Group (MSWG) comprised of representatives from each area of the business. The MSWG is responsible for guiding our approach on the subject. It marks a major development of our approach that sees us aligning across our entire business and supply chain, incorporating our own operations, from facilities management and logistics to Sainsbury’s Bank and procurement. Formal accountability frameworks and governance procedures for managing modern slavery and human trafficking issues have
3

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
been drawn up by each member of the MSWG for their specific area of the business.
Day-to-day, Sainsbury’s ethical trade team works with suppliers to ensure conformance with our Code of Conduct, build capacity and participate in collaborative industry initiatives to address slavery and worker exploitation. When issues around modern slavery or labour rights more broadly are identified in our business, whether from visits undertaken by our own colleagues, or from third-party audits, they are managed by technical and commercial colleagues, supported by a central team of ethical trade experts. At Sainsbury’s Argos responsibility for everyday management of ethical trade issues sits in the central technical team, which includes a professional ethical auditor who manages the programme of activity.
Once identified, issues are categorised by level of seriousness, and an action plan is put in place to ensure the supplier reaches compliance within a set timeframe. Any issue that is deemed high risk or is not resolved within the agreed timeframe is escalated to senior leadership. At Argos this process of issue escalation, supplier monitoring and discussion of emerging trends is managed through the Products & Supply Chain Group quarterly forum which is chaired by the Head of Quality Assurance and has representation from the corporate responsibility and trading functions.
Due diligence Our commitment to sourcing with integrity is reflected in long-standing policies, processes and partnerships on ethical trade which protect the rights of the people working in our supply chains. We are founding members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and work closely with our suppliers, government agencies, non-profit organisations, unions and others to ensure that our standards are maintained.
We recognise that the greatest risks of modern slavery are in our product supply chains and we have a wellestablished programme of supplier monitoring and compliance in place. All new Sainsbury’s grocery, clothing and general merchandise supplier sites require a third-party ethical audit from an approved audit firm and identified issues must be resolved before beginning supply. Existing product supplier

sites are regularly audited by third-parties according to their risk rating. Sainsbury’s Argos also audits direct sites according to their risk rating and monitors via Sedex and other internal systems.
We constantly track and benchmark the ongoing performance of our suppliers through bespoke reporting produced by Sedex and Lighthouse. Our technologists and ethical trade team also visit suppliers on a regular basis to ensure that our ethical requirements are met and provide support on issues where required.
We expect our Sainsbury’s brand grocery suppliers to develop an ethical trade strategy for their business, their suppliers, contractors and labour providers. Ethical strategies need to include a supply chain risk assessment which incorporates modern slavery risk, a monitoring programme for own sites, suppliers and labour providers, and training. We have regular meetings with our key grocery suppliers in which we discuss their plans in depth and encourage effective human resource management strategies, focusing on areas such as worker engagement and the responsible use of labour providers. We aim to ensure our suppliers have robust strategies in place, to effectively support workers and communicate clearly about their rights and appropriate standards in the workplace. This helps suppliers identify serious issues in the workplace when they arise, such as modern slavery and human trafficking. When grocery suppliers’ ethical trade strategies for preventing slavery and approaches to worker voice are particularly effective, we share these good practice case studies with other suppliers.
Sainsbury’s colleagues based in our sourcing offices in China, India, Bangladesh and technical colleagues based in South Africa, Kenya and Spain provide support through site visits. We are able to identify common and upcoming trends due to our close engagement with suppliers, and by using insights from reporting systems such as Sedex. This enables us to invest our resources effectively and support our supply chains, whether through a collaborative initiative, a long-term project, or developing and providing access to additional training for them.
Whilst we implement a robust programme of thirdparty social audits and collaborate with audit bodies, other retailers and Sedex to promote effective
4

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
monitoring and training of auditors, we also recognise that criminal activities such as slavery and human trafficking can be hard to identify through the traditional social compliance audit. This is why we have supported the development of innovations such as the Sedex Forced Labour Indicators, which uses new methods to identify clusters of slavery risk indicators commonly found in a social audit. We participate in an Impact Indicators pilot programme, with other retailers, which enables us to create a more holistic supplier risk assessment by supplementing audits with a new worker survey alongside other human resources metrics.
We collaborate with a wide range of partners from many sectors to support greater transparency throughout our supply chains, gather more accurate data on modern slavery risk and to improve industrywide standards for vulnerable workers. For further details on these partnerships, see below.
Risk assessment Until this reporting year, risk-assessments on our supply chain, against our Code of Conduct, were determined either through Sedex or through a particular framework designed for different areas of our business. This reporting year marks a change of approach.
Sainsbury’s Modern Slavery Working Group, with membership from across the Sainsbury’s Group, and with Board approval, has developed our risk-based approach, in relation to our existing activity and in response to the growing intelligence on where slavery and human trafficking risk exists across our industry. The complexity and breadth of our business dictates a risk-based approach, whilst ensuring that we use the best intelligence, and that the full range of our business activities are in scope.
To enable us to execute this approach, we have approached PwC and Ergon, who together have the data analytics capability and human rights expertise to create a next-generation diagnostic risk assessment tool for us that can be applied across the numerous, different areas of our business. We are able to analyse complex sets of internal and externally-sourced data against an updated range of risk indicators to provide an aggregated risk rating for specific products and

sectors within our business and supply chains. Not only will this tool help us direct our activities to the areas of greatest risk, it offers us unprecedented visibility to the multiple tiers in our supply chains, which is essential if we are to reach the most vulnerable workers. The tool can be applied across the entire range of Sainsbury’s Group businesses, with their very different structures and sectors. Once the tool has been tested and validated within our own business we plan to share its outputs with our value chains as we address common challenges.
Our understanding of exploitation, slavery and trafficking will increase greatly with the use of this new tool and we are confident that it will help us to implement an effective strategy and set of prevention and remediation activities, that are appropriate for each area of our business.
Prior to the re-calibration and broadened scope of our risk assessment, we have been working with numerous partners throughout our supply chain and directed our activities to benefit workers who are known to be at risk. Product categories in focus include fresh meat, fish and fresh produce, as well as parts of our clothing supply chain. We also know that workers recruited through labour brokers and migrant workers are particularly vulnerable and therefore have also focused our efforts on these areas to date.
The nature of slavery and human trafficking means that risks are typically found further upstream in our supply chain where we have less leverage and therefore a collaborative approach is most effective. In addition to workers recruited through agencies, we have identified migrant workers as another vulnerable group and actively participate in a range of initiatives and supplier forums, with other retailers and stakeholders, to help improve recruitment practices and working conditions. For example, UK grocery retailers have held joint supplier forums locally in Spain to address discrimination against migrant agricultural labourers and investigate the provision of labour in first and second tier suppliers. In Italy, we are part of the ETI Working Group for Italian Tomatoes, working collaboratively with our key suppliers and other UK retailers to improve conditions specifically related to recruitment practices for migrant workers at risk of coercion and exploitation.
5

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
Case studies illustrating our concerns
Two cases involving our fresh produce suppliers illustrate our concern around the responsible use of recruitment fees.
In one case the application of mandatory fees for migrant workers was identified through a third-party social audit at one of our fresh vegetable suppliers. Together, we investigated the application of mandatory travel and health insurance as a condition of work by the labour provider. This business, one of the largest labour providers into the UK food industry, amended its policy on mandatory fees following our direct engagement.
A second case involved conditions of work at a UK fruit farm in the second tier of our supply chain, which did not meet our standards. Following an extensive remediation process, the labour provider made significant changes to its business model in order to gain greater control over where and how its workers are recruited overseas. They decided to bring recruitment from mainland Europe inhouse and organise their own recruitment fairs, rather than relying on third-party agents. This means they can now ensure workers do not pay recruitment fees.

We believe that the risks around labour provision will require a formalisation of the recruitment process in order to protect workers. One of the ways we are actively driving progress towards this is by representing the retailer perspective on the technical advisory committee for Clearview, a new certification scheme for labour providers. Other members of the committee include the Institute for Human Rights and Business, the International Organisation for Migration and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. The scheme enables businesses to identify and select labour agencies that comply with good practice.
Collaboration We recognise that we cannot achieve our aims without the support of a whole range of cross-sector partners, and we have a responsibility to engage at industry level and with government on the global and growing issue of modern slavery. We believe in sharing our experience and knowledge with others, as well as continuing to develop our own understanding of the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains.
As a member of the ETI Modern Slavery Working Group we supported the inclusion of the Transparency in Supply Chains Clause in the Modern Slavery Act. Since its inception in 2015, we have contributed to a joint research initiative by the ETI and Hult International Business School on modern slavery in global supply chains.
In the UK, we engage with a broad range of institutions, including the UK government. We attend the British Retail Consortium Ethical Labour Working Group which shares best practice on tackling modern slavery and the responsible use of labour providers, amongst other topics. We have participated in a number of government consultations on tackling modern slavery and the future of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA). In 2015, our Director of Sainsbury’s Brand engaged directly with the UK Anti-Slavery Commissioner to share experience and gain insight. We welcome the UK government’s strategy to undertake a review of labour practices and the introduction of the position of Director of Labour Market Enforcement.
6

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
We also aim to support international knowledge sharing on these issues. We were invited by the Dutch government to share insights from our strategic partnership with the GLAA with experts examining the role and impact of public-private partnerships in tackling slavery and human trafficking. The UK government also invited us to contribute to the Jordan Business Taskforce, which aims to create good jobs for Syrian refugees by collaborating with suppliers, government agencies, consultants and local parties. This has involved leading a work stream on agriculture development and creating opportunities for sourcing from Jordan.
Supporting female workers in Tamil Nadu
In our clothing supply chain we have joined and fund an industry initiative, alongside trade unions and NGOs, to tackle the exploitation of female workers in the spinning mills of Tamil Nadu in India. The Sumangali, or ‘marriage assistance system’ scheme is a form of forced labour in which young women are promised a bulk sum of money after completing a few years’ work in a textile mill. Once the contract is signed, the girls have limited freedom of movement, live and work in sub-standard conditions and sometimes are not paid at the end of their contract. Following our own assessments and visits to the sites, we joined the ETI Tamil Nadu Working Group to help address these sector-wide issues. It is a five-year programme to empower female workers, strengthen industrial relations and improve grievance redress, build community awareness and support legislative reform to protect the rights of workers and provide access to remedy.

Project Issara – tackling
human trafficking and
forced labour in South
East Asia
We are active members and funders of Project Issara which was originally set up by Anti-Slavery International to identify and support victims of trafficking and slavery in the Thai fishing industry. The initiative has since become the independent Issara Institute. It publicises a hotline for victims, conducts site assessments to uncover issues through increasing worker voice, builds more ethical recruitment channels, uses technology to track and analyse migration patterns and movements of fishing boats and provides financial assistance through a fund for victim support and remediation. The number of workers participating and cooperating with Issara has reached over 60,000. More than 5,000 workers have been positively impacted by corrective actions to address labour exploitation, 468 victims of trafficking have been supported through the victim support fund and over 100 HR staff and line managers have received training on forced labour. Although initially focused on the seafood supply chain, the programme has now expanded to tackle human trafficking and forced labour across Southeast Asia.

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
Collaborative training and tools for identifying issues
We engage in a number of collaborations to support the awareness raising and capability building of our suppliers. In 2014, we established a ground-breaking partnership with the UK’s foremost investigator of labour exploitation, the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), to deliver bespoke and first of its kind training for our suppliers and farmers.
We are also founding members and funders of Stronger Together, a collaborative programme to raise awareness, gain commitment and provide tools for responsible businesses to proactively prevent and address modern slavery in their own operations and supply chains. We further support Stronger Together through our role on its Consumer Goods Steering Group.
Industry-level collaboration and funding is further evident in Sainsbury’s Argos membership of the ICTI CARE (International Council of Toy Industries, Caring Awareness, Responsible, Ethical) Committed Brands programme which provides training for factories, access to a special investigations team to respond to potential and known risks at factories and access to investigation reports. ICTI also offers an online responsible sourcing platform to drive transparency, minimise risk and help retailers track, monitor and manage toy factories in their programme, all with the aim of driving improvements in the lives of workers.

Sourcing jewellery responsibly
Sainsbury’s Argos is also a member of the Responsible Jewellery Council and actively encourages its suppliers to join. Supplier sites covered by the membership are independently audited against an international standard on responsible business practices for diamonds, gold and platinum group metals. The Council’s Code addresses human rights, labour rights, environmental impact and mining practices, amongst other topics.
Monitoring Monitoring the effectiveness of our actions to identify and prevent slavery and human trafficking is a challenge across the industry. We are working with other retailers on how to improve monitoring and impact assessment, but acknowledge that there is still a lot of work to do.
Our first step is to utilise fully the existing data we hold. During the reporting year, third-party audits at our suppliers’ grocery sites identified 17 nonconformances at nine sites which were categorised under the “employment is not freely chosen” clause of our Code of Conduct. The non-conformances related to restricting toilet breaks and workers being charged deposits for tools and work clothing. All cases were appropriately followed up and remediated.
The work of the Sedex Stakeholders Forum will improve our, and other Sedex members’, ability to track indicators of forced labour based on existing audit data. Non-conformances will be cross coded with indicators of forced labour to produce a new Forced Labour Indicator Report. Collectively we are also trying to address the structural challenges in identifying forced labour through audits: who to report the issues to when auditors are constrained by client confidentiality; appropriate procedure when the abuse
8

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
is by the client who commissions the audit; safety and security of the auditor; reporting subjective evidence observations; actions to take for the immediate safety of victims and legal considerations for brands when informed of forced labour.
We have also worked with other Stronger Together members to improve monitoring, not only tracking supplier attendance at Stronger Together training, but also tracking when suppliers sign up to its Business Partners Commitment. Stronger Together is currently piloting a new online tool for tracking implementation of practices and processes at supplier sites to tackle modern slavery.
We will continue to track the outputs of other training programmes, such as our GLAA-delivered training for Sainsbury’s suppliers on Agency Labour and the Prevention of Worker Exploitation.
Other tracking: o Monitoring and evaluation frameworks for
individual projects, such as the Issara Institute, are measuring impact by calls to hotlines and number of victims supported. These data provide a general indication of the effectiveness of our projects, but do not necessarily enable us to identify which workers are directly involved in our supply chain. o Supply chain visibility work to farm level and raw material inputs:
§ Farm data tracked by our fresh produce team: number of employees, percentage of seasonal workers, percentage of agency labour, name of labour provider, provision of accommodation and transportation, completion of SMETA or Global Gap GRASP audits, date of last audit, number of major and critical non-conformances, date of last second party visit and communication of the ETI Base Code to workers.
§ Data on child labour and women farmers on smallholder and medium-sized farms tracked through our membership of the Better Cotton Initiative. 60% of the cotton we sell is BCI certified.
o Monitoring of grocery suppliers’ ethical trade strategies such as noting and sharing good case studies on preventing slavery and integration of worker voice.

Following the outcomes from the PwC risk assessment tool we will consider the next steps we need to take to improve our metrics on slavery and human trafficking.
Training To effectively tackle slavery and human trafficking, we must raise awareness across our business and supply chain, so that responsibility for identifying issues is shared, rather than falling to a small group of experts or external stakeholders.
Technical and commercial colleagues at Sainsbury’s receive training on the ethical standards we expect and their role in supporting suppliers during their induction and on an on-going basis. This training includes guidance on modern slavery and trafficking, questions to ask and how to conduct site visits which incorporate some of the forced labour indicators. Some colleagues in grocery also attend more extensive training on slavery and trafficking which is provided to suppliers through our Technical Management Academy.
Additionally, each grocery product category team has appointed an Ethical Champion who receives additional training on ethical auditing and issue management and supports their colleagues on ethical issues, including modern slavery.
Asia-based ethical trade teams across our five sourcing offices raise awareness of modern slavery with the trading teams to ensure there is an understanding of the issues.
The regional heads of human resources for our stores have been given guidance on identifying human trafficking and slavery and who they can contact if they suspect someone may be a victim. Through the outputs of our updated risk assessment tool and the cross-business Modern Slavery Working Group, we will identify additional key staff who require training on slavery and human trafficking.

J Sainsbury plc Modern Slavery Statement 2016/17
Training for suppliers Providing training and effective capacity building for our suppliers is a key strategy for us in preventing slavery and trafficking.
We encourage all our grocery suppliers to attend our one-day ethical trade training run by an external expert which covers our ethical trade requirements and wider approach to sourcing with integrity. The training links ethical trade activities and risk mitigation with good human resource management practices, as well as giving suppliers a chance to share best practice in engaging their workforce. Encouraging good communication between workers and management fosters a healthy working environment and reduces the risk of exploitative labour practices, such as slavery and human trafficking, to go undetected.
In 2017, we launched a Sainsbury’s Ethical Trade Training Links document which signposts our suppliers to courses run by independent experts. Suppliers are able to choose from a wide variety of training covering topics such as modern slavery, agency labour and human resource management.
We regularly engage in awareness-raising activities with our suppliers. Articles featuring guidance on modern slavery have been included in our quarterly emagazine for grocery suppliers called Working Together. Our ethical trade conferences for Sainsbury’s brand grocery suppliers have included sessions on modern slavery by expert speakers from a range of organisations such as the GLAA, the Department for International Development, Seafish, Anti-Slavery International, Ergon, the ETI and Karen Bradley, then Minister for Modern Slavery and Organised Crime.
Due to identifying fresh produce and meat, fish and poultry as our highest risk categories for vulnerable workers in grocery, we launched specific supplier forums for each category to allow suppliers to share experience and learn from each other on issues such as modern slavery and identifying vulnerable workers.
We strongly encourage grocery suppliers to attend Stronger Together’s Tackling Modern Slavery in Supply Chains training. More than 85% of our direct UK suppliers have attended. We expect suppliers which

have attended to share the learning within their own business and supply chains.
We also have a long-standing strategic relationship with the GLAA to deliver bespoke training directly to our suppliers and farmers on Agency Labour and the Prevention of Worker Exploitation. The trainers provide practical guidance on how to prevent, identify and deal with exploitative practices in supply chains and farmers are given practical tools and guidance on identifying vulnerable workers. We developed the content together with the GLAA, and since then the course has been offered to the wider industry through the GLAA Academy in partnership with the University of Derby.
Despite the levels of activity across Sainsbury’s Group and with external partners, we know there is still more we can do to identify and prevent slavery and human trafficking across our business and supply chain. We recognise our responsibility to be an active participant in developing and implementing industry responses to expose and combat this criminal activity which goes against what we stand for as a business and our principle of treating people fairly wherever they are in our business and supply chains.

This statement is made by Bridgepoint Group Limited for itself and on behalf of any other qualifying Bridgepoint corporate group companies (reference to ‘Bridgepoint’, ‘we’ or the ‘Firm’ are in relation to these entities) pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act (‘MSA’). Bridgepoint’s Business Bridgepoint is an international private equity group focused on investing in market-leading mid-market businesses, working with management teams to create and realise value within its portfolio companies for the benefits of its investors. With over €12 billion of assets under management, the Firm’s aim is to deliver attractive returns to its investors by creating and realising value from middle market acquisitions. The Firm invests in six main sectors: Consumer; Manufacturing & Industrials; Healthcare; Business Services; Financial Services; and Media & Technology. The Firm operates a network of nine European bases (Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Istanbul, London, Luxembourg, Madrid, Paris, Stockholm, and Warsaw) and has offices in both New York and Shanghai. Bridgepoint’s Supply Chain We do not tolerate forced labour either within our business or within our supply chain. We expect our suppliers to share the same values and to comply with and observe the spirit of the MSA. Our key suppliers are professional services firms, office suppliers, catering and hospitality. During the last financial year, we completed a process to map our suppliers across the business and conduct an initial risk assessment of Bridgepoint’s main supply chains. This assessment has indicated that our supply chain poses a low risk of slavery, since the vast majority of our suppliers comprise well-known professional service firms. In the coming financial year, we will conduct a more detailed risk assessment of our key suppliers and where necessary, engage further with any deemed to be of high risk. We also plan to review our due diligence and contracting arrangements for new suppliers. Training and Awareness In the last financial year we have:
 Updated Bridgepoint’s Employee Handbook in order to formalise our pre-existing position on slavery
and to ensure that it is clearly understood by all Partners and staff; and
 Communicated the requirements of the MSA to senior Bridgepoint Partners.
In the coming financial year, we intend to continue to raise awareness across the Firm and update our ESG training materials to clearly reflect modern slavery and human trafficking issues. Progress on implementation of the planned measures will be reported to the ESG & Risk Committee.

Statement
Our commitment to tackling modern slavery
Our mission is to inspire people to love fish now and for generations to come. To achieve this, we believe in doing right by our planet, our partners and our people, whether they work as part of our internal team or are part of our supply chain. We operate a policy of zero tolerance towards Modern Slavery. Not only because it is our legal obligation to do so, but because it is the right thing to do. This is a responsibility that everyone here takes very seriously and we support this by our pro-active approach to risk analysis, buying policy, worker training and the provision of appropriate management policies and reporting channels throughout our business.
Our business and supply chains

We’re the largest manufacturer of value added fresh, chilled and frozen seafood products in the UK. Whilst we’re predominantly a seafood business, we also manufacture some added value and recipe meal products using other types of protein such as beef and chicken.
We have manufacturing sites in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, producing food products that carry the Young’s suite of brands as well as major multiple retailer own labels.
We procure raw materials from both domestic UK fisheries and fish farms as well as from overseas sources. We also buy non-fish raw materials, recipe ingredients, packaging items and a range of other goods and services.
Our policies and contractual controls
All raw materials, co-packed products, ingredients, packaging items, goods and services are procured by a central Procurement Department under the management of a board level director. We have a rigorous process which governs the award of all commercial contracts, sourcing from businesses that meet our strict commercial and technical standards. This includes a risk test for the likelihood of Modern Slavery within the supply chain.
Within our own manufacturing facilities, we have Human Resource policies on Preventing Hidden Labour Exploitation and Whistleblowing. These policies apply to all our employees.
Due diligence and audits of our suppliers and supply chain
We are a member of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex). So that we can conduct effective risk analysis of our supply chains, all our suppliers are required to register themselves onto the Sedex system and to allow us to see their audit results and self-assessment details.
Our suppliers are assessed in terms of their vulnerability to hidden labour exploitation. Members of the our commercial and technical teams (or our

appointed and approved representatives) visit our suppliers on a regular basis and audits are carried out in accordance with a schedule based on risk.
Some supply chains are externally audited against third party standards which include an assessment of the ethical treatment of labour. For example, we source aquaculture products from supply chains certified to the Aquaculture Stewardship Council and the Global Aquaculture Alliance and 100% of our palm oil (and palm derivatives) comes from suppliers certified to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) scheme.
Our key performance indicators
With a seat on the Oversight Board of the new Seafish Responsible Fishing Scheme (RFS) since its inception, we have been active in the development and roll-out of the scheme and are committed that all of our UK supply chains will be RFS certified by the end of 2017. We’re also working to assist the roll-out of the RFS scheme into international fisheries and we expect that these supply chains will also be RFS certified or certified to an equivalent social standard by the end of 2021.
Our anti-slavery training
In order to raise awareness within our own business, those responsible for labour sourcing, recruitment and worker placement processes have ‘Tackling Hidden Labour Exploitation’ training.
Courses attended by our personnel in the last 12 months include: the Seafish Modern Slavery Workshop, the Home Office Modern Slavery Workshop and the Stronger Together Workshop, which we hosted at our Grimsby site.
All our first line managers and all workers (whether Young’s Seafood employees or agency workers) go through our business induction courses and internal training schedules.

Modern Slavery Statement
Aldi UK operates with honesty and integrity wherever it does business around the world. We respect human rights and treat the people in our supply chain who make, grow and supply our products fairly.
This statement has been published in accordance with Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It explains the steps taken by Aldi UK, and other relevant group companies, during the year ending 31st December 2017 to prevent modern slavery and human traficking in its business and supply chains.

Introduction:
Modern slavery is a global problem affecting every economy, industry and sector. In 2017, the UN’s International Labour Organisation estimated that more than 40 million people were victims of modern slavery, including almost 25 million workers trapped in forced labour.
Human traficking, forced labour and the exploitation of vulnerable workers are abuses of basic human rights and have no place in our business or supply chain.
Our approach to tackling these problems is based upon understanding the complexities of the issue and continually improving the processes we have in place to prevent these abuses from occurring.
This involves working in partnership with our suppliers and their business partners to ensure all our operations and supply chain remain free from modern slavery.
Aldi UK published its irst Modern Slavery Statement in May 2017, and during the past year we have continued to improve our processes and developed new partnerships with third parties to tackle this important issue.
Key progress in 2017:
• Extending our Ethical Trade Programme to cover more product areas. This programme focuses on improving working conditions at sites where our products are sourced from.
• Strengthening our existing supplier policies on the responsible use of labour providers, in line with industry best practice guidance from the Stronger Together initiative and the Association of Labour Providers.
• Encouraging our suppliers to attend Stronger Together workshops to help them spot signs of modern slavery and take appropriate action.
• Introducing ethical requirements for our Goods Not for Resale suppliers.
• Establishing new partnerships with NGOs and third parties, including the Food Network for Ethical Trade.
• Increasing the number of Fairtrade, UTZ and Rainforest Alliance products stocked.

Our business:
Aldi UK is part of the Aldi South Group, an international supermarket chain that operates more than 5,900 stores across nine countries.
We opened our irst UK store in Birmingham in 1990 and have rapidly grown to become Britain’s ifth largest grocer by market share, with more than 750 stores.

Our ethos today is exactly the same as it was when our irst UK store opened more than a quarter of a century ago; we treat all customers, suppliers and employees fairly and with respect.
This approach extends to our relationships with more than 2,100 suppliers across 71 countries.

Modern slavery strategy and policies:
Aldi South Group’s
International CR Department

They deine our commitment to human rights and fair labour and set out the minimum standards that we expect from our suppliers. These include:

Corporate Responsibility (CR) UK & Ireland

Ethical Audit Team
Bangladesh

Ethical Audit Team
Hong Kong

No use of forced or bonded labour

No use of child labour

Aldi UK has an integrated modern slavery strategy based on comprehensive policies and processes, effective risk-assessment, training and ongoing reviews and dialogue with suppliers.
Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) department is responsible for the design and implementation of this strategy in the UK and Ireland. They are supported by the Corporate Buying department, the Aldi South Group’s International CR department and our specialist ethical audit teams based in Bangladesh and Hong Kong.
Like many international businesses, we source products from a range of countries and recognise there is a risk of modern slavery in our product supply chains.
To mitigate this risk, we have developed comprehensive policies and processes that all suppliers must sign up to before we work with them.
These include Aldi’s Social Standards in Production, which form part of our standard terms and conditions and are based on the following international policies:
• The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights
• The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
• The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
• The International Labour (ILO) Conventions
• The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises

Payment of legal minimum wages

A maximum length for a working week

Freedom from discrimination in
the workplace

All suppliers are required to apply these standards across their own supply chain and to any approved sub-contractors that work for them.
As forced or bonded labour issues are often hidden from view, we also support the development of new responsible recruitment initiatives, such as Clearview, a certiication scheme speciically designed for labour recruiters and providers.

2

Identifying modern slavery risk within our supply chain:
Modern slavery is a complex and hidden problem. To detect this issue, we undertake regular risk-based due diligence across the full scope of our business and supply chains.
Ethical Trade Programme Our Ethical Trade Programme aims to improve working conditions at sites that make Aldi products, particularly those in high-risk countries or product categories.
All suppliers in the programme must be a member of a supply chain management platform, either the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex) or the amfori Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI).
To show that they can meet our ethical standards and requirements, suppliers must also arrange for one of the following independent third-party ethical audits or certiication of their production sites, which have been approved by Aldi:
• Amfori BSCI (Business Social Compliance Initiative) ethical audit
• SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit)
• ICTI Ethical Toy Program
• SA8000 (Social Accountability International standard)
• Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) audit, formerly Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC)
We expect our suppliers to take responsibility for monitoring and improving working conditions at all sites in their supply chain which are used to produce our products. We also expect them to adopt an approach to ethical trade that goes beyond compliance.
However, we know from experience that third-party audits may not always provide a true picture of working conditions at a supplier site. In addition to third-party audits, we also carry out our own ethical audits and site visits through our Aldi Social Assessment programme.
Aldi Social Assessments These assessments are carried out by a team of qualiied ethical auditors based in our CR ofices in Bangladesh and Hong Kong. This local expertise means we can directly monitor and address issues on the ground in high-risk sourcing countries.
Our teams regularly carry out announced, semiannounced and unannounced site visits and assessments of supplier facilities to check they meet our ethical standards and requirements.

They also focus on building co-operation and gaining increased transparency from suppliers so that we can work with them to improve conditions for workers in all sites that produce our products.
Managing risk in our business:
We source our products from 71 different countries around the world and recognise there is a risk of modern slavery in all parts of the supply chain, from where the product is made or grown through to its journey to our stores.
To mitigate this risk, we have a comprehensive system of checks and controls in place to identify high-risk areas in our supply chain and wider business.
These include third party ethical audits, Aldi Social Assessments and insight gained through collaborative initiatives with stakeholders such as Stronger Together, Sedex and the British Retail Consortium.
This risk assessment is complemented by in-house ethical trade experts at our CR departments in the UK and the wider Aldi South Group, including our specialist ethical audit teams on the ground in Bangladesh and Hong Kong.
We also have an Aldi Alert Line that can be used by suppliers and employees in conidence to raise concerns or report any policy violations. The Alert Line is promoted to employees and suppliers. This independent service is staffed by multi-lingual call handlers and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All reports are fully investigated and callers always remain conidential.
The risk of modern slavery is higher in supply chains for certain product types and geographical territories than others, such as tea from India and seafood from Thailand.
During the last 12 months, we have deepened our understanding of the speciic risks that workers face in these supply chains by participating in several initiatives:
• Opening a dedicated CR ofice in Bangladesh to forge closer relationships with suppliers and further strengthen our monitoring on the ground.
• Establishing a Working Group for an Ethical Sourcing Strategy for Food, comprising of experts from our CR International teams and national country CR teams including Aldi UK, to increase collaboration and momentum on ethical risks in the supply chain, including modern slavery.

• Joining the Food Network for Ethical Trade (FNET).
• Introducing ethical requirements for our Goods Not for Resale suppliers and engaging with Stronger Together on their construction programme.
• Participating in the British Retail Consortium Ethical Labour Working Group to help shape industry decisions and share best practice with other retailers.
• Supporting our suppliers to improve their capacity to identify and remediate critical issues themselves.
Whenever possible, we also try to source products that are produced under standards that create better social and environmental conditions for workers.
These include Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and UTZ.

Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh We were one of the irst signatories of both the original Bangladesh Accord in 2013 and the follow-on agreement in 2018. Through this agreement, we support measures to improve health and safety within garment factories in Bangladesh.
Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex) We require all of our suppliers to become members of either Sedex or amfori BSCI. Sedex provides a collaborative platform for buyers, suppliers and auditors to quickly identify and share indicators of forced labour and modern slavery.

Partnerships:
We recognise that a single organisation acting on its own cannot eradicate modern slavery, and the most effective way to tackle an issue of this complexity and scale is through collaboration.
As a result, we continue to establish partnerships and collaborate with others to raise awareness of modern slavery and ind solutions for workers. A full list of our collaborations and partnerships relating to ethical trade and modern slavery are as follows.

Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI)
Aldi has been a member of amfori BSCI for more than ten years. Through this membership, we can monitor non-compliances in our supply chains and production facilities, which in turn helps to identify modern slavery risks.

Stronger Together
Since 2013, we have been project sponsors of Stronger Together, a multi-stakeholder initiative aiming to reduce modern slavery within supply chains. Stronger Together use labour rights experts to run workshops across the UK. These help suppliers understand what modern slavery is and how to spot warning signs. Aldi UK have strongly encouraged all UK suppliers to attend a workshop and download the tools and guidance from the Stronger Together website.
We are also supporting Stronger Together as it expands globally and moves into other areas of the supply chain, such as the construction sector in the UK and the fruit and wine sector in South Africa.

British Retail Consortium (BRC)
Aldi UK are active members of the BRC and several sub-groups including The Ethical Labour Working Group. This group brings the retail industry together to collaboratively tackle unethical practices in supply chains. In 2017 the Group called on Government to strengthen the Modern Slavery Act, by publishing a list of all companies required to report and including public procurement bodies, and it also called on Government to strengthen enforcement of labour practices to safeguard workers in high risk sectors. It allows us to engage with other businesses in our sector to share best practice and discuss speciic issues relating to modern slavery. Through the BRC, retailers also work towards aligning our approach to modern slavery in the supply chain.

4

Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP) This partnership enables us to improve the responsible sourcing of ish and seafood and to avoid illegal, unregulated and undocumented ishing, contributing to a more transparent seafood supply chain.
Seafood Ethics Common Language Group Participating in this group allows us to collaborate with other retailers, food service organisations and suppliers to improve our understanding of the ethical issues impacting the seafood supply chain and contribute to collaborative efforts to improve ethical standards in the sector.
Food Network for Ethical Trade (FNET) FNET is a collaboration between large food suppliers and retailers that share a goal of establishing a common approach to managing ethical trade in food supply chains. At the heart of this initiative is the sharing of resources and developing best practice ways of working.
Gangmasters & Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) The GLAA operate a licensing scheme which regulates businesses that provide workers to the fresh produce supply chain and horticulture industry, to make sure they meet the employment standards required by law. Employment agencies, labour providers and gangmasters who provide workers to the following sectors will need a GLAA licence: • Agriculture • Horticulture • Shellish gathering • Any associated processing and packaging Aldi UK have worked with the GLAA for many years to help identify and protect workers at risk of exploitation in our supply chain.

Impact – Stronger Together
Aldi is a project sponsor of the Stronger Together initiative. Stronger Together is a business-led, multi-stakeholder collaborative initiative whose purpose is to support organisations to tackle modern slavery within their businesses and supply chains.
Through www.stronger2gether.org, Stronger Together provides clear guidance and pragmatic resources and training to support employers and labour providers in at risk sectors to deter, detect and deal appropriately with forced labour, labour traficking and other hidden labour exploitation.
Since its launch in October 2013, the Stronger Together initiative has achieved signiicant traction in engaging business:
• Over 8,000 industry representatives have registered with www.stronger2gether.org to access the resources for use within their organisations.
• Over 3,700 individuals from over 1,400 businesses have attended and have committed to take the tackling slavery message back to over 800,000 workers. Online UK and international “Tackling Modern Slavery” e-learning training modules have been taken by an estimated 36,000 learners.
• An Independent Impact Assessment measured the impact of the programme from Oct 2013 Sept 2017 amongst UK consumer goods suppliers.
Key indings were that being involved in Stronger Together: increased their knowledge and understanding of what modern slavery is (96%); helped them prepare and understand how to manage potential situations of forced labour (87%); and resulted in their senior management making a commitment to tackle modern slavery in their business and supply chain (72%).
• Stronger Together has launched the Stronger Together South Africa Programme to support the fruit growing and wine-producing industries to tackle forced labour and hidden labour exploitation through free training workshops and multi-language resources. The awareness raising video ‘Eyes Wide Open’ received a Gold World Medal at the New York Festivals TV & Film Awards 2018 for Instruction & Education.

How we ensure modern slavery is not taking place:
Through our Ethical Trade Programme, more than 1,100 ethical audits were carried out in 2017 by independent third parties and by Aldi’s own ethical audit teams.
These audits identiied a number of issues, mainly relating to working hours and health and safety issues. However, we have identiied a few cases where there was a risk of modern slavery.
In each of these cases, corrective action plans were implemented that set out a clear process and timeline for resolving these issues. Suppliers had to then implement these corrective measures in the speciied timeframe through collaboration with the site management.
Our approach is to work collaboratively with our suppliers to resolve any issues or problems. When a problem arises, the type of corrective action implemented will depend on severity of the issue and the willingness of the supplier to work collaboratively with us to ind a solution.
Case study – Detecting modern slavery
One of our long-standing fresh produce suppliers identiied a case in its own supply chain of vulnerable workers being exploited by a third party.
As the supplier had undergone modern slavery training, it had robust checks in place to quickly identify and handle this situation.
The supplier immediately informed the GLAA and the local police, who subsequently brought a successful prosecution against the third party for human traficking and forced labour.
In instances like this, we work collaboratively with the supplier and the authorities to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. As soon as the supplier proactively informed Aldi of the situation, we sent members of our CR and Buying teams to visit the supplier site and carry out a thorough check of the working conditions, including worker interviews, document reviews and an interview with the third-party labour provider.
We held several face-to-face meetings with the supplier, including their senior HR representative, to understand how the issue occurred and to offer support to the supplier to prevent it happening again.

Although independent third-party audits are an important tool for identifying problems and initiating improvements, they can only provide a snapshot of a particular situation. Introducing permanent improvement to working conditions at the sites we source from requires a collaborative approach to ethical trade between Aldi and our suppliers.
Aldi Factory Advancement Project
The Aldi Factory Advancement (AFA) Project is an initiative we introduced to improve the working conditions at factories that produce our textile products in Bangladesh.
The project enables managers and workers to identify potential problems within their production facilities and develop joint solutions. It includes training in areas such as health and safety in the workplace, ire safety, working hours, discrimination and harassment as well as productivity and quality management.
Launched in 2013, the project now covers almost half of our garment production facilities in Bangladesh and more than 80,000 employees have experienced positive changes in their day-to-day working environment as a result of their engagement with the project.
The project was extended in February 2018 with the launch of AFA Project PLUS, which aims to tackle the shortage of adequate childcare for working parents and their children in garment factories.
Working in collaboration with NGOs and other thirdparty organisations, Aldi supports suppliers in improving their existing childcare facilities and the quality of care provided.
Testimonial – Aldi Factory Advancement Project
“I am so happy to have been part of the AFA Project for the past three years. Through the trainings of the AFA Project, I was able to share ideas and problems directly with the management. We have advanced our factory in many different areas by workers and managers jointly discussing problems, deciding on solutions and implementing them. Now we have reduced discrimination and I was promoted from sewing operator to supervisor as one of the irst females in my factory. In the future, I want to become a line chief.”
Ambia, a sewing operator from a factory that participates in the AFA Project

Training and capacity building:
To effectively tackle modern slavery, we must raise awareness of this issue across our business and supply chains. It is vital that colleagues and suppliers are trained to spot issues and have the skills and conidence to deal with them as soon as they arise.
Training for employees
• All Aldi Buying employees are trained on how to ensure suppliers uphold the ethical standards that we set. They work closely with our CR departments to monitor suppliers’ performance and intervene if any issues are found.
• Since 2015, our CR team has run a number of modern slavery training sessions for employees in our Buying department. This training includes guidance on modern slavery, including relevant questions to ask and what to look for during site visits.
• All new employees with buying responsibility receive one-to-one training as part of their induction, to ensure they have a thorough understanding of ethical trade issues, including modern slavery.
Training for suppliers
• All suppliers are asked to attend Stronger Together workshops which are part-funded by Aldi. These sessions are led by labour rights experts and help suppliers understand what modern slavery is and how to spot warning signs. Since these workshops began in 2013, more than 500 delegates from suppliers of Aldi have attended.
• We have hosted conferences with suppliers to train and educate them on ethical trade and modern slavery.
• As part of our Aldi Social Assessment programme, suppliers whose sites are scheduled to receive announced visits are fully briefed on the approach and objectives of the programme before the assessments take place.
• The Aldi Factory Advancement Project provides training for suppliers in Bangladesh on a range of subjects including health and safety in the workplace, ire safety, wage issues, working hours and discrimination.
Conclusion:
Modern slavery is a global problem that cannot be solved by any one company or organisation acting in isolation. Aldi has a role to play in raising awareness of this issue and working collaboratively with suppliers, NGOs and industry partners to combat this criminal activity.

Forward-looking plans:
During 2018, we will continue to reine and develop our processes and policies to reduce the risk of modern slavery in our business and supply chain. The proactive steps that will be taken include:
• Broadening existing partnerships with key groups such as the Food Network for Ethical Trade and Stronger Together. For example, we are supporting Stronger Together’s expansion in South Africa by strongly encouraging all our produce and wine suppliers in South Africa to attend a workshop.
• Supporting the Spain Ethical Trade Forum, a collaboration between retailers, suppliers and growers to improve working conditions in the Spanish produce sector, which we signed up to in April 2018.
• Developing a strategy to assess the risk of modern slavery in high-risk categories, including produce and horticulture.
• Earlier this year, we signed up to the British Retail Consortium’s Better Retail Better World initiative, a collaboration between 25 of the UK’s largest retailers, who have agreed to implement a policy that no worker should pay for a job, which is a key issue in tackling modern slavery.
• Developing an ethical trade strategy for food that will identify risks and put safeguards in place. In 2018, we will work with a third party consultancy specialising in ethical trade to carry out a full risk assessment of the Aldi South Group food supply chain, to help us prioritise based on issue criticality and our level of inluence. In addition, we will work with the consultancy to develop an overarching Ethical Sourcing Strategy including: prioritised list of risks; ‘deep-dives’ of ethical risks for high-risk products; development of KPIs to measure progress and a inal report with recommendations to manage risks and drive change.
There is no place for modern slavery in our business or our supply chain and we remain committed to combatting this criminal activity.

ENVIRONMENTS FOR LEARNING MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
Environments for Learning Limited (“the Company”) Modern Slavery Statement & Human Trafficking Statement for the financial year to 30th September 2018 This statement is made pursuant to s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps that the Company has taken and is continuing to take all reasonable endeavours to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking is not taking place within our business or supply chain. Modern slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced labour. The Company has a zero-tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to putting effective systems and controls in place to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the business or our supply chain. Company Overview The Company was formed to act as the Holding Company for a number of special purpose vehicle subsidiaries (“SPVs”), together the “Group”, whose business is to develop contracts with local authorities to build schools, learning and leisure facilities of excellence. As at 30 September 2018 the Group has developed contracts for building and operating schools with the following clients: Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, Leeds City Council, St. Helens Borough Council and Plymouth City Council. These contracts include PFI projects to:
Design, build, finance and operate 1 school in Sandwell; Design, build, finance and operate 5 schools, 1 well-being centre and 2 leisure centres in Leeds; Design, build, finance and operate 1 school in St. Helens; Design, build, finance and operate 2 schools in Plymouth. In addition, the Company has 4 design, build and operate contracts in Sandwell and several design and build contracts (D&B Contracts) for schools in Leeds, Sandwell, Plymouth and St Helens. The Company operates a number of policies to ensure that it is conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner, including antibribery, Health & Safety, and Data Protection. The policies explain the manner in which we behave as an organisation and how we expect our suppliers to act. The Company has no direct employees; however, it does have in place a Management Services Agreement with Albany SPC Services Limited (“Albany”), which provides the services of a Finance Officer, Company Secretary,General Manager and other management staff to the Company. Albany operates a robust recruitment policy, including eligibility to work in the UK, and checks for all employees to safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will. Supply Chain The Company works with key supply chain partners. Under the PFI projects, long-term construction and facilities management subcontracts were put in place at the time when the PFI contracts were signed. Due diligence was undertaken into the financial status, operating policies and practices, including ethical, of the subcontractors prior to the subcontracts being signed, with the principal subcontractors requiring to be pre-approved by both the SPVs and our clients and to hold any required accreditations or appropriate qualifications for the services that they would deliver. Under the PFI contracts, the principal supplier of services is Interserve Construction Limited (“ICL”) who provides the construction and facilities management services throughout the life of each project. ICL also supplies construction services for the design and build elements for the D&B contracts. The Company recognises that there is a risk of slavery and human trafficking in the construction and facilities management sectors, and therefore expects ICL to adhere to a policy of zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking both within its own organisation and in any of its own supply chain partners who may provide services on its behalf to the PFI or D&B contracts, and has sought and received assurances and evidence of its policies and operational practices in this respect. In addition, the Company and each PFI contract have agreements in place with Lenders to provide credit facilities; the Company believes this area of activity is very low risk in relation to slavery and human trafficking. The Company intends to provide this statement to its key supply chain partners and to monitor their policies.

This statement will be reviewed on an annual basis.
This statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 25 March 2019.

We also provide corporate and administrative services to other Hitachi Group companies. Our UK business, and its overseas branch and representative offices, employs approximately 281 people and had a turnover in the 2017 financial year of approximately £150 million.
Our supply chain
A significant proportion of the products we supply are manufactured by Hitachi Group companies in Japan with others coming from Asian markets including China, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. We have approximately 54 active trade suppliers (of which over 20 are Hitachi Group companies) and approximately 1098 non-trade suppliers.
Our Policies
We are committed to conducting business ethically and to minimising the risk of slavery or human trafficking in our own business and in our supply chains as much as possible.
We continue to refer to our company and Group policies, which address issues relevant to slavery and human trafficking and which include:
The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct (LINK) The Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy (LINK) The Hitachi Guidelines for Procurement Activities (LINK) Written employment practices and procedures which ensure fair recruitment and treatment of employees. A written whistleblowing procedure to encourage employees to report concerns of malpractice, which would include any concerns related to slavery and human trafficking issues.

Our progress to date
Over the last year, we have:
1. Improved supply chain assessment and communication
We previously requested information from our business groups to map our suppliers to assess the potential risk of modern slavery being present. We have identified the gaps in this information and will request further information to complete this process. Through Hitachi, Ltd. our suppliers have received a revised version of the Hitachi Group CSR Supply Chain Guidelines. These guidelines address relevant labour standards for suppliers such as freely chosen employment, minimum worker age, working hours, wages and the expectation of humane treatment.
2. Provided awareness raising and building expertise
Our CSR Team presented to procurement colleagues across Hitachi Group companies on Modern Slavery in the supply chain at the annual Hitachi Group European Procurement Meeting. We held workshops with relevant colleagues from Hitachi Europe business groups to outline expectations related to modern slavery and human rights and to discuss future plans. We requested employees undertake the online e-learning programme we procured in FY2016. The training, raises awareness of different forms of modern slavery and trafficking and explains how these should be reported. All employees were requested to undertake the training by Hitachi Europe’s Managing Director to coincide with a message from Hitachi, Ltd. President and CEO Toshiaki Higashihara on international Human Rights Day. We ran a collaborative learning project for those responsible for procurement across Hitachi Group companies in Europe. Supported by Shift, an expert Human Rights non-profit organisation, the project focused on addressing social issues in the supply chain through two workshops.
i. Workshop 1 explored the core concepts of the Guiding Principles and discussed how these apply in practice to a company’s procurement practices.
ii. Workshop 2 discussed application in practice, with a specific focus on possible changes that could be made to procurement practices to better identify, prioritise and address human rights risks that participants identified might arise in their supply chains.
3. Collaborating with external organisations and stakeholders
We continued to participate in or are members of: The UN Global Compact’s UK Modern Slavery Working Group (MSWG), taking part in a Modern Slavery statement peer review exercise with members of the MSWG and feeding learning across Hitachi Group companies. We have benefited from cross-sector learning, including presentations and discussion with the Chartered Institute of Building, Hope for Justice (a global non-profit organisation) and the UK’s Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner. CSR Europe’s Human Rights Group, which has allowed us to build enhanced capability through training on Human Rights Due Diligence. BSR (Business for Social Responsibility), a global not for profit, participating in their Human Rights Working Group. We took part in peer learning, openly discussing challenges and solutions. SHIFT’s Business Learning Program, benefiting through shared learning on best practice and support from peers and stakeholders. TechUK’s Sustainable Supply Chain group, providing access to learning from peers in the tech sector on Modern Slavery.
4. Monitoring progress
We have started identifying potential relevant KPIs to monitor progress.
Our future plans
Over the coming year we plan to focus on the following areas:
Improved supply chain assessment and communication. Identify high risk suppliers including clarifying expectations.
Monitoring progress. Finalise KPIs to monitor progress.
Awareness raising and building expertise. Building on the outputs from the workshops held with Group Businesses we will look to develop a Human Rights Working Group for relevant procurement colleagues in Hitachi Group companies in Europe to embed Human Rights Due Diligence processes and identify tools to support the due diligence. This will provide a common platform for peer learning. Further develop our risk analysis of our suppliers and increase awareness with key suppliers as appropriate. Increase employees’ participation in the modern slavery e-learning programme and in particular identify key functions for a more targeted approach.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Hitachi Europe Limited’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 31 March 2018. It has been approved by Hitachi Europe Limited’s Board of Directors.

85,"The Hershey Company: Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement Complying with both the California Transparency Act and the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act
Our Company
The Hershey Company, together with its subsidiaries, is committed to operating responsibly and sustainably throughout the world. Hershey has a history of operating with high ethical standards and integrity. The manner in which our employees and business partners manage social, environmental and economic impacts is critical to our long-term business success.
Responsible Sourcing at Hershey
The Hershey Company is committed to having a responsible, sustainable and ethical supply chain. We have laid out expectations for certain issues and ingredients that go beyond the requirements of our Supplier Code of Conduct and reflect our commitment to a transparent supply chain. These commitments include our position on cocoa sourcing, farm animal welfare, pulp and paper sourcing, responsible palm oil sourcing, and sustainable sugar sourcing. Key examples of Hershey’s commitment in action include our approach to sourcing cocoa and improving the well-being of cocoa communities. Hershey is committed to purchasing 100% certified and sustainable cocoa, and each certification program prohibits the use of forced and illegal child labor. Beyond purchasing certified and sustainable cocoa, Hershey is working with our suppliers as they are conducting farmer training programs through Hershey’s Learn to Grow program, which seeks to boost productivity and incomes through training on good agricultural practices. Through Learn to Grow, Hershey is also building schools and teaching about our labor expectations. Please visit our Responsible Sourcing website to read more about how Hershey is taking action to address labor and environmental issues.
Hershey uses independent third-party auditors to conduct social audits of our own plants, contract manufacturers, and our suppliers. These audits are conducted to the SEDEX Member Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) standard developed by the Associate Auditor Group of the Sustainable Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX). SMETA is a prescriptive audit procedure that is a compilation of effective ethical audit techniques and include health, environment, safety, and labor criteria such as forced labor and human trafficking. We share the audits of our facilities with our customers and also request audits of our suppliers and partners through SEDEX, a platform that facilitates swift exchange of audit information. We will continue to regularly conduct these audits at our own facilities and will continue to request these audits of our suppliers as we expand into new geographies around the world.
The backbone of Hershey’s commitment to a responsible and sustainable supply chain is our Supplier Code of Conduct. This document sets forth Hershey’s standards and expectations for suppliers with respect to corporate and social responsibility. We require our suppliers to acknowledge their understanding of and adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which serves as a key governing component of our business relationship with these third parties.
As outlined in the Supplier Code of Conduct, our goal is to work with our suppliers to assure compliance with the following requirements:
Legal and Compliance
Suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their countries of operation.

Social and Working Conditions
Forced Labor: Hershey does not tolerate forced labor. Suppliers must not utilize or benefit in any way from forced or compulsory labor nor utilize factories or subcontractors that force unpaid labor.
Child Labor: Hershey is committed to the elimination from its supply chain of illegal and forced child labor. We expect our suppliers to support and participate in industry efforts aimed at the elimination of such practices, wherever they exist in the supply chain.
Working Hours and Wages: Suppliers should provide wages at least equal to the applicable legal minimum wage and any associated statutory benefits, and working hours should reflect applicable legal norms, which includes supplier compliance with applicable laws regarding working and overtime hours.
Freedom of Association: Consistent with local regulations, employees’ right to freedom of association should be respected by suppliers, including that employee relationships are voluntary in nature.
Non-Discrimination: Supplier hiring and employment decisions should be made solely on the basis of skill, ability and performance by the workers, and discrimination is not permitted on the basis of race, religion, gender, political opinion, national extraction, or social origin.
Health and Safety: Suppliers must provide employees with safe and health working environments and practices must comply with all relevant local and national laws, codes, and regulations.
Supplier Verification and Audits
Hershey reserves the right to monitor, review and verify supplier compliance with the principles set forth in the Supplier Code of Conduct, either through third-party certifications or a responsible sourcing audit, which may be performed by a third party. In the event the Company becomes aware of non-compliance, we maintain the right to set forth corrective actions and/or terminate our business relationship with the supplier.
Hershey’s Code of Conduct
Hershey has committed to operating with the highest of ethical standards. This commitment dates to the founding of our company and has earned Hershey a reputation for fairness and honesty throughout the world.
Hershey’s Code of Conduct sets forth the standards by which we conduct our operations and establishes a clear expectation that the standards be followed in all job-related activities, regardless of business pressure. It further memorializes our commitment to consumers by maintaining the trust consumers place in our brands, providing the best products in the market and adhering to honest marketing practices.
Employee Training
Our Code of Conduct is distributed to all Hershey employees and is supplemented by targeted training and communications addressing the values set forth within it. Every year employees must complete training modules or acknowledge the standards, guidelines and practices set for in our Code of Conduct. Noncompliance with the Code of Conduct and related Company policies may subject employees to discipline, up to and including termination.
* * *

Should any employee, customer, consumer, or business partner have concerns about the conduct of The Hershey Company or its partners, confidential reporting is available at www.HersheysConcern.com. Hershey will continue to update our policies, programs and commitments as Hershey and our supply chain continue to develop. We will also continue to publish our Responsible Sourcing efforts on our corporate website as well as in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report.

86,"Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement

Our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
The Co-operative Bank is defined by its Values and Ethics and we are committed to ensuring that our operations, supply chains and the way we do business are aligned with those values. We work with our customers and suppliers to uphold the standards set out in our Ethical Policy, which include environmental sustainability, human rights and social responsibility. We take a zero-tolerance approach to breaches of our policies and standards on modern slavery and human trafficking and we will always take action to investigate suspected incidences of modern slavery or to immediately address any confirmed incidences.
As part of this commitment and in line with our regulatory obligations we publish this annual statement outlining the policies, procedures and training we have in place to both prevent incidences of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and supply chains, investigating suspected incidences and how we address confirmed incidences.
We also publish an annual Values and Ethics Report, which reviews our performance against our Ethical Policy. Our Values and Ethics report can be found here:
co-operativebank.co.uk/assets/pdf/bank/news/valuesand-ethics-report-2015.PDF

About The Co-operative Bank
The Co-operative Bank is defined by its Values and Ethics and is a retail and SME bank based exclusively in the UK. The majority of our supply chains are also based in the UK. We operate from 95 branches across the UK and several large offices primarily based in the North West of England. Our supply chains include goods not for resale (such as paper, stationery, uniforms, furniture and marketing materials), ICT equipment and services, professional services such as auditing and accounting, and business services such as cleaning, catering and facilities management.
Further information about the Bank, its strategy and its structure can be found in our Annual Report and Results and our Interim Results, which can be accessed here:
co-operativebank.co.uk/investorrelations
Our Approach
Our approach to tackling unethical or illegal activity in our business and supply chains begins with our culture and values. Co-operative values, reflected in our customer-led Values and Ethics Policy are embedded in our Articles of Association, ensuring that they guide the management and conduct of the Bank. Compliance with this policy is overseen by the Values

and Ethics Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Board of the Bank, and chaired by an Independent non-executive director. The Values and Ethics Committee reviews the Bank’s activity to ensure it meets our commitments as set out in our Ethical Policy. The Bank’s risk framework enables the Bank, to assess regulatory, legal and reputational risks. This is overseen by the Risk Committee, a sub-committee of the Board of the Bank.
Our revised Ethical Policy was published in January 2015 and reflects input from around 74,000 customers and colleagues. The Policy provides a framework for all employees of the Bank, from those in our branches to our senior executives to ensure that Values and Ethics are reflected in decisions at every level. The core principles of the Ethical Policy include promoting human rights and equality, and reducing poverty by supporting international development. These values and ethics are also reflected in our business policies, practices and culture, guiding our colleagues on their duty of care and responsibility to each other.
We expect our suppliers and our business and corporate customers to uphold the same values and commitments as set out in our Ethical Policy. We seek to work with suppliers, partners and customers who can make a positive contribution to our pursuit of sustainable development, both in terms of environmental sustainability and social responsibility.
As well as a strong culture of Values and Ethics, the Bank also has several specific policies and processes in place that make clear our expectation that our colleagues, suppliers and nonpersonal customers behave ethically and always comply with the law in the UK and overseas, based on the principles set out in our Ethical Policy:

• Our Supplier Management Framework sets out how we work with suppliers throughout their relationship with the Bank, including regular re-screening against our Social Goals criteria.
• Codes of conduct and training for all of our colleagues and contractors setting out the ethical standards we expect them to meet
Further information on all of these processes can be found below.
Our Ethical Policy
Our Ethical Policy sets out our commitment to be an ethical bank and ensure we have ethical supplier relationships. This includes:
• Our commitment to paying the National Living Wage (as calculated by the Living Wage Foundation) and encouraging our contractors and suppliers to become Living Wage employers, and in doing so require our contractors to pay employees operating at our sites the UK Living Wage
• Upholding the right of all employees to join a trade union if they wish
• Ensuring co-operative values are embedded in our workplace culture.

Our Risk Management Framework • A risk framework that all colleagues across the Bank use to identify and manage regulatory, legal and reputational

risks
• Resourcing policies that we follow when recruiting new colleagues or working with employment agencies

• Outsourcing must be managed in line with the Bank’s Material Outsource Operating Model (MOOM) arrangements or Supplier Management Framework
• Initial and ongoing risk assessments of Third Party Suppliers must be conducted
• Where a third party uses another third party (subcontractor) to meet its obligations to the Bank, they must manage the third party (subcontractor) in line with the Third Party Supplier Risk Policy and its supporting control standards, and this arrangement must be disclosed to the Bank.
Our Resourcing Policies
When recruiting colleagues or working with employment agencies, we use a number of policies and procedures to ensure that we always behave ethically and manage risk:
• All permanent, temporary and contractor recruitment is outsourced to a third party. One of the criteria for the selection of our external recruitment partners is that they must have a Slavery and Human Trafficking policy.

compatible with our Ethical Policy, before any commercial contracts are agreed, or services supplied. We ask all suppliers to undertake a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire, which includes questions, and asks them to confirm that they agree with a range of statements about, their labour practices and standards. We also gather information from third party sources such as journalists, NGOs, trade unions or employees.
The Social Goals screening enables us to identify high risk supply chains by gathering information about their business, parent or subsidiary companies and the sectors and jurisdictions in which they operate, at the outset of our relationship. We review our larger suppliers against our Social Goals process on an annual basis (as per our Supplier Management Framework). The Social Goals process also helps to ensure we don’t provide banking services to businesses that don’t meet our ethical standards, such as upholding human rights.
For full details of our Social Goals process, please see our latest version of the annual Values and Ethics Report: co-operativebank.co.uk/assets/pdf/bank/aboutus/ ethicalpolicy/full-values-and-ethics-report-2015.pdf

• We undertake an annual payroll audit to ensure all of our colleagues are being paid at least the Living Wage Foundation rate, including an audit of our employment suppliers’ payroll.

We ask suppliers to confirm that they do not breach our Sustainable Procurement and Supplier Policy (SPSP), which sets out our expectations that a supplier’s core activities are sustainable, fair, legal and ethical. This includes a number of terms relating to labour standards. For example:

Our Tendering and Contracting Process
In addition to our SPSP, during the on-boarding process suppliers are required to agree to our standard terms and conditions, confirming that they:
• Will remain in compliance with all Regulations, both at home and abroad

As set out in our SPSP, we adopt a zero-tolerance approach to basic standards of conduct. If breaches of basic standards occur, such as those involving corruption, fraud, bribery and modern slavery, we require suppliers to address these immediately. We expect action to be taken to investigate the conduct, remediate where possible, and ensure plans are put in place to avoid the situation recurring. We would always report any suspected criminal activity to the relevant authorities in the UK or overseas.

• Comply with all customer policies concerning ethics, antibribery and/or anti-corruption as well as with any relevant industry code on anti-bribery.

Whistleblowing

Our Supplier Management Framework
Once they become a supplier of goods or services to the Bank, our Supplier Management Framework and Third Party Supplier Management Policies set out how we continue to work with our commercial suppliers on a day to day basis, throughout the lifetime of their contract. As part of the Framework, we review these suppliers against our Social Goals criteria annually. Suppliers who present a higher risk may be screened more often.

The Bank is committed to ensuring that colleagues can seek advice on and report any work-related concerns that they do not feel able to raise with their line manager, such as unethical behaviours, dishonesty or breaches of internal policy. We maintain a Concern at Work service through which all colleagues can report concerns by telephone, text or email. All concerns are treated sympathetically and in the strictest confidence by trained internal investigators experienced in dealing with sensitive issues.

We also monitor the progress of our suppliers in developing and implementing ethical improvement initiatives.

Training our Colleagues

Liam Coleman Chief Executive

As part of our risk-based approach we provide the following training to our colleagues to ensure they uphold our values and ethics
• The Bank’s Code of Conduct sets out how we expect all colleagues to conduct themselves with other colleagues and wider stakeholders. The Code helps ensure the Bank complies in full with its obligations and takes an appropriate attitude to risk. There is also a separate Code that covers contractors and agency workers.
• We update both Codes regularly to provide clarity on the roles and responsibilities of our leaders and colleagues, underpinned by our Values and Ethics. Everyone, whether a colleague, contractor or agency worker, is required to complete a mandatory e-learning module on the Code every year and to agree to comply with it and so uphold our Values and Ethics.
• Investigating suspected incidences of modern slavery and human trafficking

87,"STATEMENT AGAINST SLAVERY & HUMAN TRAFFICKING
EMC is committed to social and environmental responsibility and has zero tolerance for slavery and human trafficking. As part of this commitment, we have adopted the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition’s (EICC) Code of Conduct (the “EICC Code”) as the EMC Supplier Code of Conduct to which we hold ourselves and our supply chain accountable. The EMC Supplier Code of Conduct prohibits the use of forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons. EMC considers each supplier’s conduct vis-à-vis the EMC Supplier Code of Conduct when awarding and/or renewing business with the supplier.
EMC has also published our Human Rights and Global Labor Principles, which are based on international labor and human rights standards. These principles reinforce and strengthen our commitment to the rights of our employees, workers in our supply chain, and workers in the global community. The Principles are available on EMC.com.
EMC has taken a variety of actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in our supply chain, including the following:
Verification & Risk Assessment:
Internal assessment of supply chain risk based on international indices, supplier performance (e.g., audit and spot check results), and other indicators of supplier-specific risks. This risk assessment is conducted annually, and incorporates data on human trafficking incidence from the U.S. State Department’s annual “Trafficking in Persons Report,” as well as other risk factors including human rights risk and country governance and accountability. Supplier-specific risk incorporates data regarding labor management systems, the demographics of the workforce, and the use of labor agents. More information on EMC’s methodology is available under “Evaluating Supplier Site Risk” in EMC’s Sustainability Report.
Audits
On-site verification of EICC Code conformance through independent, third-party audits that are announced, as well as through spot checks conducted by EMC employees in-region. The third-party audits follow the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which includes an assessment of the suppliers’ policies and practices with regards to human trafficking risks and controls as well as their management and oversight of their own suppliers, with particular emphasis on any labor brokers. Spot checks assess a set of key social and environmental indicators, including indicators related to forced labor. We select supplier sites to audit and to spot check based on the verification and risk assessment described above. Additional detail and statistics on both audits and spot checks, as well as a discussion of findings and associated corrective actions, are available in “Monitoring and Assessment” in the Supply Chain Social and Environmental Responsibility section of EMC’s Sustainability Report.
Supplier Certification
• Certification from suppliers of compliance with all applicable laws, including those related to freely chosen employment, through the EICC Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). Supplier sites showing high risk on the SAQ are audited, and supplier sites demonstrating known risk factors for human trafficking are investigated with regard to those issues specifically and, depending on the outcome, may be audited as well.
• Acknowledgements of the EMC Supplier Code of Conduct from 100% of EMC’s Tier 1 and strategic Tier 2 direct suppliers. This industry-standard Code includes a substantive section on human trafficking. Compliance with the Code is also part of our standard contract language for all EMC vendors, and evaluated through the SAQs and audits referenced above.
Internal Accountability
Internal accountability standards and procedures to help confirm that employees and suppliers meet EMC standards. This program is intended to ensure that EMC employees and suppliers are aware of and adhere to established standards and processes. Supplier

accountability occurs through mechanisms ranging from audit corrective actions (see “AUDITS,” above) to supplier scorecards and quarterly business reviews. For more detail on how accountability is built into our work with suppliers, see “Business Integration” in the Supply Chain Social and Environmental Responsibility section of EMC’s Sustainability Report. EMC also maintains corporate-wide accountability and grievance mechanisms (e.g., the EMC Ethics Hotline), which are available to both employees and external parties. For additional information, see the Governance section of EMC’s Sustainability Report.
Training
Training all EMC supply chain management professionals on the EMC Supplier Code of Conduct. This includes employees at all levels of the commercial and engineering supply chain organizations, and is conducted regularly through a variety of training approaches, from in-person, all-day workshops to online modules. Human trafficking is consistently covered as part of the training provided. EMC’s Global Supply Chain Management organization has responsibility for implementing and monitoring compliance to all of the supply chain activities described above. Our focus on slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort to encourage supply chain transparency and accountability. We will not tolerate forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons by any EMC supplier or for any other purpose. For additional information describing the structure of EMC’s direct materials supply chain and our supply chain responsibility program, see the Supply Chain section of EMC’s Sustainability Report and the Sustainability section of EMC’s website. For more information about our business, see the business description available in EMC’s annual 10-K filing.

88,"WÜRTH MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2016/17
This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out the steps taken by The Würth Group and other relevant group companies during year ending 2 April 2017 to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains.
MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
Würth UK Limited maintains relationships with many different organisations in its supply chain, as well as employing directly large numbers of people. In the light of the general law on employment and human rights, and, more specifically, the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the policy summary below underpins the Company’s approach and will be used as a basis for the company’s Statement on Slavery and Human Trafficking. The full policy is enclosed for your information.
INTRODUCTION
We know that slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking (Modern Slavery) is a global and growing issue given the rapid rise in global migration, existing in every region in the world and in every type of economy, whether industrialised, developing or in transition. No sector or industry can be considered immune or untainted. Würth UK Limited has a zero tolerance approach to Modern Slavery of any kind within our operations and supply chain. We all have a responsibly to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. The Staff is expected to report concerns, using the appropriate reporting channels, and management are expected to act upon them.
OUR BUSINESS AND GROUP STRUCTURE
The Würth Group is a wholesaler of fasteners and tools, who operates worldwide and employs over 65,000 people. Approximately 30,000 of these are permanently employed sales representatives.
The Würth Group is world market leader in its core business, the trade in assembly and fastening materials. It currently consists of more than 400 companies in over 80 countries with more than 66,000 employees on its payroll. In the business year 2014, the Würth Group generated total sales in excess of EUR 10 billion.

OUR SUPPLY CHAINS
Würth UK Limited Supply Chain division is extremely focused on our customers. Our philosophy of business ‘Direct Selling’ thrives absolutely on the efficiency of our supply chain. World class warehousing, demand planning, accuracy, timeliness, integrity and fair business practices rule the value system of this function, which either operate in business areas adjacent to the core business or in diversified business areas, round off the range by offering products for DIY stores, material for electrical installations, electronic components (e.g. circuit boards) as well as solar modules and financial services.
OUR POLICIES ON MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Our opposition to modern slavery and human trafficking reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to eliminate, as far as possible, the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking taking place anywhere in our business or supply chains.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We understand that our biggest exposure to Modern Slavery is in our product supply chains, where we have undertaken activity over last decades to minimise the risk of Modern Slavery. Within these areas, new suppliers and factories/sites are subject to due diligence checks in the form of ethical/compliance audits conducted by or on behalf of Würth UK Limited. Such audits are also regularly conducted for existing suppliers and factories/sites. These audits assess compliance with the Global Sourcing Principles and are, amongst other things, intended to identify any Modern Slavery practices. If issues are identified, appropriate investigative and remedial actions will be taken.
ASSESSEMENT OF EFFECTIVNESS IN PREVENTING MODERN SLAVERY
We understand that Modern Slavery risk is not static, and will continue our leading approach to mitigating this risk in the year ahead. In order to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken by Würth UK Limited we will be reviewing the following key performance indicators and reporting on them in future Modern Slavery
Statements: • Staff training levels; • Actions taken to strengthen supply chain auditing and verification; steps taken to up skill our high risk suppliers, and assessing their ability
to detect and mitigate modern slavery risk in supply chains; and investigations undertaken into reports of Modern Slavery and remedial actions taken in response
MODERN SLAVERY TRAINING
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and in our supply chains, we will be asking our business partners to provide training to their staff and suppliers. We have developed Ethical Trade training, which covers Modern Slavery, which is now being rolled out across the business.

GAME’S ETHICAL TRADING PRACTICES
Human Rights and Anti-Slavery Transparency Statement
The below statement has been prepared in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) and sets out steps taken within the business to prevent slavery and human trafficking.
Our Business and its Supply Chains
GAME Digital plc (the “Company”) is the ultimate parent company of GAME Retail Limited (“GAME”) which operates retail stores and concessions across the UK. The products GAME sells are sourced from a broad range of national and some international suppliers. Physical products range from gaming consoles, software and related accessories to merchandise including apparel. International supplier relationships are managed by our dedicated commercial teams.
Related Policies
When sourcing quality products for our business, we endeavour to partner with suppliers that comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law in relation to the prevention of slavery and human trafficking and share our core principles. These include not participating or working with organisations that operate inappropriate or unfair working practices. We look to ensure that our suppliers maintain satisfactory working conditions and comply with all legal requirements with respect to labour practices, health and safety, human rights and environmental protection standards of the countries in which their businesses operate.
Our values apply equally to all companies across the Group and are set out in our Business Code of Conduct which our suppliers are required to comply with. Our Business Code of Conduct sets out our policy on employees, legislation, child labour, conditions of employment, wages and benefits, health and safety, the environment and modern slavery and human trafficking.
Risk Assessment and Due Diligence
We work with reputable service providers, many of which are also subject to the Act. We take the management of our supply chain seriously and believe that it is important to responsibly select supplier partners.
Significant progress has continued to be made with all first tier commercial partners contacted as part of a high-level assessment of the businesses’ exposure to the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking.
All first tier supplier partners have contributed their information and additional information has been sourced or requested to enable the business to get a full picture of risk. As a result of this review, several suppliers have been flagged as potentially being high risk (where, for example, their production facilities are located off-shore) and we are in the process of determining the steps required to audit these high-risk suppliers. Where clear non-compliance with our processes by suppliers has been identified, we have terminated a small number of contracts. Work is also underway to identify our second tier commercial suppliers with a view of gathering information by following similar risk assessment processes.
We have made significant progress with first tier non-commercial suppliers in 2018, covering: temporary staff; logistics and distribution; security and guarding; our customer services centre; and cleaning and catering. Multi-functional meetings have been held internally and the approach taken with commercial partners has been shared to ensure consistency with process and to ensure best practice.
All first tier non-commercial suppliers have been contacted and an initial review of feedback is underway. Each returned questionnaire will be reviewed and assessed in line with the processes followed for our commercial suppliers.

Our due diligence procedures for supplier on-boarding have also been updated to include our modern slavery policy and processes of review, with a plan to roll this out. Our supplier audit processes are being reviewed to ensure they identify any risk of modern slavery and human trafficking. Ensuring Effectiveness Whilst we have taken steps to analyse the risk that suppliers may pose and were satisfied with the responses to our initial enquiries, GAME will continue to monitor suppliers in this area. Should any instances of non-compliance with the Act arise in relation to any of our suppliers then this will be reviewed and appropriate action taken. Related Training We continue to communicate the requirements of the Act to GAME’s key partners in the UK and briefing sessions have again taken place with the commercial and non-commercial representatives responsible for liaising with suppliers and the wider Group. We regularly communicate to the business updates to related policies that highlight the risk of modern slavery, housed on our e-learning zone. The second phase of the development of our E-learning zone is in progress and will involve an interactive quiz to encourage learning across all GAME employees. 2019 Action Plan We are aiming to build on the progress made in 2018, with the following action plan in place for 2019:
Further investigate suppliers where we have identified a risk, through engagement and visits to supplier premises, conducted directly or by a third-party agency. Continue the assessment process on first tier, non-commercial suppliers. Continue to develop the e-learning programme, tailored to specific audiences in the business with all buyers required to attend a quarterly refresher training session. The above statement was approved by our Board of Directors of GAME Retail Limited and GAME Digital plc on 6 December 2018. For and on behalf of the Boards of GAME Retail Limited and GAME Digital plc.

We also source products from Key manufacturing partners around the world, including China, TRhEPaLiAlaCnEdM,ENSTwPeAdRTeSn, Poland and Finland.
Our policy on slavery and human trafficking
    JELD-WEN Ltd is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in its supply chains or any part of  the business.
Each year JELD-WEN will sign 2 declarations as part its FSC and PEFC certification commitments (both referencing the ILO conventions relating to slave labour). Suppliers of JELD-WEN are asked to sign the JELD-WEN code of conduct which includes, laws regarding human trafficking and slavery.

In addition, JELD-WEN also signs a statement “JELD-WEN Timber Policy Statement” each year in accordance with both FSC and PEFC criteria.

Due diligence process

As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we use a process of supply chain mapping, whereby timber suppliers who are deemed to have a significant risk associated with the country/region of harvest are asked to complete a supply chain map. The supply chain is traced back to the forest source to enable full supply chain transparency. Documents are recorded at each stage to provide evidence that our suppliers are certified and committed to the ILO core conventions.

Although JELD-WEN UK don’t currently audit timber suppliers we do have a written policy for EUTR (European Union Timber Regulations) providing permission to audit supplier’s facilities on request.

All employees are expected to work within the requirements of the company policies and procedures. Any employee who may suspect a human trafficking violation are required to report it to JELD-WEN’s legal department or to JELD-WEN’s confidential ethics hotline.

Training

All JELD-WEN employees who have direct responsibility with the supply chain are trained to ensure understanding of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and its importance.

Williams Lea Tag Group has taken and is continuing to take appropriate measures and implement practices to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking is not taking place within our business or supply chain. This statement constitutes Williams Lea Tag’s statement on slavery and human trafficking for the financial year ending 31 December 2018.
Modern slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced labour. Williams Lea Tag has a zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery. We are strongly committed to playing our part in eradicating modern slavery by ensuring we act ethically and with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to putting effective systems and controls in place to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the business or our supply chain.
Williams Lea Tag is the leading provider of marketing and communications supply chain services. We help organizations transform business processes, enhance customer conversations and realise the potential of their brands. Our solutions combine re-engineered processes, leading technologies and highly experienced collaborative client teams. Our financial strength and global reach enables us to deliver these solutions anywhere in the world.
Our Policies
Our internal policies ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner, such as:
Recruitment policy - which includes vetting, eligibility to work, safeguards our employees against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will.
Code of Conduct - our code defines the objectives and rules that reflect our commitment to responsible, ethically irreproachable and legally compliant behavior from all employees and contractors.
Whistleblowing policy - if there are concerns regarding any unethical conduct within our business, including any forms of modern slavery, we strongly encourage our employees to report the concern so we may properly and quickly resolve the situation. An external and independent whistleblowing hotline service operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, across approximately 40 countries enabling our employees to report matters anonymously, without fear of reprisal.

Our Suppliers
Williams Lea Tag works with a wide and varied network of vendors to execute and support solutions that we design for our clients. Supplier due diligence is a critical part of what we provide for our clients and essential for the security and performance of our own business.
All suppliers to Williams Lea Tag must go through our due diligence process at the on-boarding stage and are then subject to regular audits and reviews. These audits are based on perceived risk (i.e. country of supplier, strategic importance of supplier, and handling of confidential data) with a tiered approach taken to ensure each supplier’s corporate social responsibilities are aligned with that of Williams Lea Tag and, most importantly, full compliance with the Modern Slavery Act is met.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets the minimum standards for doing business with Williams Lea Tag, and is signed by each supplier as part of the onboarding process, with a follow up questionnaire sent after 6 months of onboarding to ensure our policies are adhered to.
If we find breaches of our code and/or the Modern Slavery Act within our supply chain, we will investigate the issues in

detail. Whilst we shall, of course look to support companies in their efforts to comply with the legislation, in the event of a serious breach, termination of the supplier relationship may also be considered.
Key Performance Indicators We will know and understand the effectiveness of the steps that we are taking to ensure that slavery and/or human trafficking is not taking place within our business or supply chain if: - No reports are received from employees, the public, or law enforcement agencies to indicate that modern slavery practices have been identified. - Completing annual due diligence, where necessary, on our supplier’s code of conduct. - Further raise awareness across the global WLT procurement teams, on indicators of modern slavery in the supply chain, and how best to respond and escalate any concerns identified. - Develop a training module that will be undertaken by all Williams Lea Tag employees to raise a general and consistent understanding of this subject across WLT. This will outline what modern slavery is, how to identify it and what individuals should do if they suspect it is taking place within, or associated to our organisation.
Looking Forward We are committed to continually improving the way we educate and inform our employees about modern slavery. Going forward, we aim to: - Further raise awareness across the global WLT procurement teams, on indicators of modern slavery in the supply chain, and how best to respond and escalate any concerns identified. - Develop a training module that will be undertaken by all Williams Lea Tag employees to raise a general and consistent understanding of this subject across WLT. This will outline what modern slavery is, how to identify it and what individuals should do if they suspect it is taking place within, or associated to our organisation.

93,"Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2019 Hallmark Care Homes Group Holdings Limited and subsidiary companies (‘Hallmark Care
Homes’)
Hallmark Care Homes is a family-run provider of multi-award-winning care homes. We have 18 care homes across England and South Wales and are recognised in the industry for providing high quality care and innovative facilities. We pride ourselves on our vision ‘to be recognised as the leading provider of high quality, relationship-centred care for all residents’. The Hallmark Care Homes Charter enshrines our key values and establishes our organisational culture.
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires commercial organisations operating in the UK, with an annual turnover in excess of £36 million, to produce a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year of the organisation. This statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our Group's slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2019. It demonstrates the steps Hallmark Care Homes has taken, and will continue to take, to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking is not taking place within our business or supply chain.
Modern slavery is an international crime affecting over 40 million people around the world. It includes victims trafficked from overseas and vulnerable people in the UK, who are forced to work against their will. Hallmark Care Homes has zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking in all its business dealings. We are also committed to the prevention of slavery and human trafficking, in all its forms. We will not tolerate or condone it within any part of our business or supply chain.
Structure and supply chains
We have surveyed all suppliers and have produced a report on their organisational structure and supply chains including:
• the main services provided and the procurers of these services; • the company structure; • the structure of supply chains; • the location countries of supply chain; • whether suppliers are engaged seasonally and the percentage of employees on tempo-
rary/seasonal contracts;
We have reviewed the information received by suppliers, and there are no concerns. Neither are there any suppliers which we deem to be high risk with regards to slavery or human trafficking. We will conduct this survey each year, reviewing information returns and acting on any concerns we have.
Through our reviewed procurement policy, we have introduced measures to ensure adequate procurement pricing and prompt payment is in place.
Page 1 of 3

Policies and procedures
As part of a pre-defined review of all relevant HR/personnel policies, appropriate guidance on modern slavery has been developed and introduced. These reviewed policies state our expectations of the team and how they should handle concerns they have around modern slavery. They also reassert our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery practices.
We have also reviewed our Procurement policy and have ensured that an assessment of modern slavery practices is conducted, both prior to contracting with a new supplier, and as part of any tender process. We have introduced a standard modern slavery term which will included in all new service level agreements with suppliers, moving forward.
Due diligence
We have surveyed suppliers who exceed the turnover threshold on their modern slavery practices. Following this, we have been able to assess:
• The current processes to ensure that human trafficking and slavery do not exist in supplier’s operations and supply chain.
• Whether suppliers work with a third party to identify the overall risks of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain.
• Whether suppliers conduct independent, unannounced audits of their operations and suppliers.
• Whether suppliers require their direct suppliers to certify that all materials incorporated into their final product were sourced, processed and manufactured in compliance with the human trafficking and slavery laws of the country, or countries, in which they operate.
• The company’s standards on human trafficking and slavery. • Whether management employees, particularly those in charge of supply chain management,
have been trained to understand what slavery and human trafficking are and how to mitigate the risk of them in their respective supply chains.
We have also received and reviewed these companies Slavery and Human Trafficking statements. This information will be reviewed each year and any queries will be raised with the supplier directly.
Risk assessment and management
The risk linked to modern slavery have been assessed and are managed via the Group’s quarterly Risk Management committee. The risks, along with existing and required mitigating controls, are stated on the Group’s organisational risk register. These are reviewed ahead of each meeting and modern slavery, as a topic, is a specific agenda item on a bi-annual basis.
Effective action taken to address modern slavery
There have been no disclosures or any identified instances of modern slavery within the company, or supply chain, to date. We have whistleblowing procedures in place which allow our team to raise concerns of any nature internally to our Managing Director, or externally via a dedicated neutral phone service.
Page 2 of 3

Owing to both the existing systems we had in place, and the progress made as highlighted in this statement, we are confident that should disclosures be made, we have appropriate systems and processes in place to ensure corrective action is taken promptly. Training We have conducted face to face training for senior leaders in the organisation which will be refreshed every 3 years. We have provided an information factsheet to all other team members. This is on prominent display in the team area in each of our care homes and will be checked during biannual quality assurance audits. Over the coming financial year, we plan on developing further training for the team to embed knowledge and understanding in this area.
This statement has been formally approved by both, the Executive Leadership Team and the Shareholders of Hallmark Care Homes Group Holdings Limited (and subsidiaries) and signed on
their behalf.

During the Applicable Period, PWP UK had rigorous HR policies and procedures in place which, among
other things, limited the prospects of modern slavery occurring; consultants were subject to the same
background checks as permanent members of staff. PWP UK continues to apply a rigorous approach
We have determined that, during the Applicable Period, in broad terms the following supply chains
were used to enable us to deliver financial advisory services to our clients:
Providers of certain outsourced services (including IT analysts, cleaning and security
Professional advisors (such as accounting, tax, audit legal and compliance)
Suppliers in relation to its office space (such as IT, telecoms, office furniture and
PWP UK undertook a risk assessment of: (i) its current staff profile and recruitment processes

MODERN SLAVERY ACT
Statement on Slavery and Human Traf cking Grange Hotels are committed to improving our procedures to combat slavery and human traf cking both within our own business and that of our supply chains. As part of our due diligence processes we shall make enquiries with all new suppliers as to the mechanisms they have in place to combat slavery and human traf cking and we will require all new suppliers to express their commitment to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Organisation's Structure We are a collection of private luxury hotels located in London. We have circa 2000 employees and primarily operate within the UK.

Our recruitment processes are transparent and reviewed regularly. We communicate directly with candidates to discuss job opportunities and to con rm the details of any offer made and work only with reputable recruitment businesses. We have robust procedures in place for the vetting of new employees and ensure that we are able to con rm their identities and that they are paid directly into an appropriate, personal bank account.

We have fairly extensive supplier relationships. Each outsourced service supplier is carefully considered as are other suppliers when awarding or renewing business. We review our suppliers on a regular basis and have committed to work with organisations who share our values. We monitor and review the controls undertaken by our suppliers and now require, from our key suppliers, an annual statement of their commitment to our Supplier Code of Conduct.

We are conscious that imported products or services sourced from outside the UK or EU are potentially more at risk of slavery or human traf cking issues. If products have to be sourced from such locations, we will look to those suppliers who can demonstrate a commitment to human rights and fair working conditions.

We will not work with any supplier organisation that has been found to have been knowingly involved in either human traf cking or modern slavery.

Training

To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human traf cking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to relevant staff as part of their induction and provide refresher training as appropriate.

Our Supply Chains

We have long standing relationships with our supply chains the majority of whom also operate within the UK but we do contract with suppliers from or whom operate in other jurisdictions.

Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Traf cking

We shall undertake annual review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure that here is no slavery or human traf cking in our supply chains with a view to identifying further steps that we can take.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the slavery and human traf cking statement of Grange Hotels.

96,"Paragon Banking Group PLC (‘PBG’) considers acting responsibly in its operating markets, caring for its people and treating customers fairly as key principles to be held at the heart of everything it does.
One of PBG’s aims in meeting these principles is that employees, job applicants, retailers, business introducers and suppliers should be treated fairly and that they should not be disadvantaged by unjust or unfair conditions or requirements. As part of this, PBG is committed to ensuring that there is no slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour or human trafficking in its supply chains or within any part of its operations. The exploitation of anyone who is employed by PBG or who works with PBG towards achieving our business goals will not be tolerated.
PBG supports the objectives of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ‘Act’) in raising awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking. As required by Section 54 of the Act, PBG presents its slavery and human trafficking statement for its financial year ended 30 September 2018. This statement is drawn up in accordance with the available government guidance.
Our business
PBG is incorporated in the UK, listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a member of the FTSE 250. PBG has a number of subsidiary companies, which, together with a number of other related entities are included in its consolidated financial reporting (together the ‘Group’).
The Group is a banking group, headquartered in Solihull, whose operations are conducted wholly within the UK. It does not operate in any areas generally considered to have a high risk of incidence of modern slavery and human trafficking. The Group’s supply chain is mainly focussed on the procurement of professional and office services within the UK, which, again, are not considered to be high risk sectors for modern slavery and human trafficking.
This statement is made by PBG and applies to all the entities within the Group. Regulatory and corporate details regarding the Group’s subsidiaries can be found at http://www.paragonbankinggroup.co.uk/regulatory-status https://www.paragonbankinggroup.co.uk/companydetails
Policies on slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking
PBG is committed to ensuring that none of these offences occur in its supply chains or in any part of its business. The Modern Slavery Policy was approved by the boards of PBG and relevant subsidiaries and reflects a groupwide commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all business relationships.
The Group is subject to the UK Human Rights Act 1998. The Board of PBG has overall responsibility for ensuring that all areas within the Group uphold and promote respect for human rights. The Group’s policies and procedures seek to anticipate, prevent and mitigate any potential negative human rights impacts as well as enhance positive impacts. In particular, this is managed

through policies regarding employment, equality and diversity, modern slavery, conduct risk and information security.
The Group’s approach to managing its risks is embedded through its policies and procedures and through its Group Operational Risk Management Framework. The policies and procedures provide our colleagues with clear minimum standards driving behaviours which reflect the Group’s values and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
The Group’s policies are formulated and kept up to date by the relevant business area, authorised in accordance with the Group’s governance procedures and communicated to all employees through a number of methods as well as through Human Resources policies.
In addition to the Modern Slavery Policy, the requirements of the Act are reflected in a number of the Group’s policies/procedures including recruitment, whistleblowing and anti-bribery and corruption.
Impact on our business
The Group has assessed its employment arrangements and its HR Policies and has determined that the risk of offences, related to modern slavery, being committed is low.
The Group utilises a relatively small number of contractors (short and longer term) and apprentices to support its business needs. All employees, whether permanent, temporary, contracted, or on an apprenticeship scheme, are thoroughly vetted prior to appointment, and are paid on an equivalent basis for equivalent roles.
In addition, the Group adheres to the standards of the Living Wage Foundation which are reviewed on an annual basis.
Rigorous recruitment processes are in place to ensure that where a third party is appointed to assist with recruitment they do not charge recruitment fees to the individual being considered for appointment.
Verification of all individuals is also undertaken, as required by UK legislation and regulation, prior to their appointment and for certain roles this includes criminal record checking.
Impact on our supply chains
The Group initially assessed its supply chain (including its business introducers) and determined that the risk of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking in this area was low, due to the concentration of these suppliers in the UK and within industries generally considered low risk. This risk assessment remains valid.
During 2018 the Group has continued to follow processes applied since 2016 to assess areas of potential risk in relation to the Act. It identifies which of its suppliers could be considered to be in areas of greatest risk, and then contacts them together with the Group’s larger suppliers

determined by invoicing cost, to ascertain whether they have appropriate procedures in place to combat modern slavery. The results of these exercises have not raised any concerns.
In addition to maintaining previously applied standard processes PBG has also recruited a Supply Chain Manager into a newly created role. This appointment has been made as part of the Group’s objective to ensure a consistent approach in the application of outsourcing and supplier management principles across its businesses.
Continued development of the outsourcing and supplier management framework are now managed by the Supply Chain Manager, reporting to the Operations Director, and operating within the governance structure outlined by the Group’s Operational Risk Committee.
The principles of the framework are intended to ensure that the Group continues to:
1.   identify, assess and monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains; 2.   mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains; and 3.   protect whistleblowers.
In relation to the requirements of the Act, the objectives of the framework will:
1.   ensure that each supplier is assessed in respect of Modern Slavery at the point of contracting in order to determine whether the Group’s approach to monitoring that supplier’s compliance with the requirements of the Act should be at a high, medium, or low level;
2.   enable early identification of supply chain issues, including any relating to modern slavery; and
3.   ensure each supplier is monitored, in accordance with its risk assessment, throughout the cycle of the business relationship.
4.   Training 5.   As part of its commitment to ensuring that employees are aware of and comply with
relevant legislation and the Group’s Modern Slavery policy, a dedicated on-line training module and assessment module was designed and rolled out to all employees during 2017. All employees undertake refresher training on the module annually and it forms part of the Group’s induction training.
Our effectiveness in combating slavery and human trafficking
The Group uses the following key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) to measure how effective it has been in ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of the business or the supply chain.
•   Whistleblowing reports – during the year ended 30 September 2018 no incidents of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour or human trafficking relating to the Group’s employment arrangements or its supply chains were recorded through the whistleblowing process or came to the Group’s attention through its other management and human resources processes.

•   Supplier review – based on assessment of all active suppliers, 17% of the Group’s suppliers have been identified as in areas of greatest risk in relation to the Act, and as such have been further assessed in-line with process. These assessments have not raised any material concerns.
•   Modern slavery on-line training module completion rates for 2018 – 95.51% of employees (excluding those on long term sick and maternity leave) completed the module.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2017 / 2018 VUR Village Trading No 1 Limited (""Village"") is publishing this statement in compliance with Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This statement is made for the financial year ending 2017 and details the steps taken by Village during this year.
ORGANISATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY Organisational Structure Village is part of the VUR group (the ""Group"") and our ultimate parent company is VUR Holdings (UK) Ltd (‘Holding Company’), which has its head office in the United Kingdom. This statement is made by Village as the company that actively carries out business in the UK on behalf of the Group. Village is a UK-based company operating 29 Hotels throughout the UK. We employ around 4,000 employees. Our hotels provide full hotel services including bedrooms, spas and leisure and gym facilities with significant food and beverage offerings. The Group has an anticipated annual worldwide turnover of £200 million in 2018 (all from within the UK). Responsibility We recognise that although slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking (‘Modern Slavery’), is illegal it remains a growing issue in the UK. In an increasingly global marketplace, we also recognise that all businesses have a responsibility to understand whether modern slavery and human trafficking is taking place within their businesses and supply chains and this is a responsibility we take seriously. We are committed to making meaningful and long term improvements to workers’ employment and workplace conditions including but not limited to the prevention of forced, bonded and trafficked labour. We do this through our policies and

governance, which are supported by a committed organisation and our leadership. We also recognise that the hospitality industry can be at a higher risk of exposure to Modern Slavery for the following reasons:
 having a high percentage of staff who are from overseas;  having a transient workforce;  having a diverse supply chain.
SUPPLY CHAIN We procure goods and services directly from over 1000 first tier UK based suppliers in three main areas; Furniture, fixtures and equipment, food and beverage and operational supplies (goods not for re-sale). We have contractual relationships with all of our suppliers and a dedicated procurement department to oversee the instruction of major supplier agreements and ensure that adequate procedures are in place. We subcontract general maintenance and construction works services to a number of small providers in the UK. When building a new hotel we currently contract with one main UK based contractor who will then subcontract elements of the construction work. We have a number of low tier indirect suppliers throughout the world, primarily related to our food and beverage offering. We employ the majority of our workforce directly; we have a small number of independent agents working for Village. These independent agents tend to be IT consultants (working centrally) or personal trainers (based in the gym facilities at our hotels). All independent agents are contracted with directly. We have two franchise arrangements operating within Village, both of which are under a contractual arrangement.
OUR POLICIES We recognise that effective policies are crucial for combatting Modern Slavery. We have an Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking Policy in place that sets out our
2

Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement
overall approach to Modern Slavery at Village. We are committed to ensuring we are not supplied by anyone who engages in human trafficking and modern slavery. Our Right to Work Policy and Recruitment Policy are followed to ensure, as far as possible, that migrant workers are not exposed to exploitation and that the business is not exposed to the fraudulent recruitment of employees. We also operate a Whistleblowing Policy aimed at employees which encourages staff to report any wrongdoing. We intend to extend this policy to our wider supply chain. General Counsel has overall responsibility for our Modern Slavery policies.
RISK MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE In 2017 / 2018 we sought to identify and address risks of Modern Slavery in our supply chain and we have:
 Carried out a first tier risk supplier mapping exercise in order to identify suppliers that fall within an area that is at high risk of Modern Slavery, and we have addressed Modern Slavery with these suppliers by requesting copies of their policies and procedures and advising them that there will be an audit trail in place over the next year for dealing with compliance.
 Addressed Modern Slavery as a formal business risk and put in place a mitigation plan that will be reviewed at quarterly meetings and owned by Heads of Departments within the business who will manage those mitigation plans.
 Reviewed our procurement processes to identify Modern Slavery as a risk to be identified and assessed on supplier audits.
 Ensured the Right to Work policy is followed with strict compliance.  Reviewed our policies on Modern Slavery and considered implementation.
STEPS TAKEN IN 2017 / 2018 In 2017 / 2018 we have taken the following steps:
 Implemented a supplier code of conduct with a particular focus on areas that are more susceptible to Modern Slavery.
 Produced quarterly reports to the Board assessing the risks from suppliers, employees and any other areas which could be affected by Modern Slavery
3

Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement
 Included training on the risks of Modern Slavery into our induction for Senior Roles.
 Reviewed our recruitment process considering Modern Slavery as a risk.  Mapped our employee’s countries of origin to identify which geographic
locations within our business are more susceptible to Modern Slavery.  Engaged with the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) to
develop hotel specific guidance for employees and the potential exposure to Modern Slavery within hospitality.  Shared best practice and the future of Modern Slavery within hospitality at a roundtable event for hospitality.
During 2018 / 2019 we will:  Produce and develop a specific employee code of conduct which will clearly set out our approach to Modern Slavery and communicate to the wider business and to our suppliers how it can be identified and how we intend to deal with it. This was initially sought to be addressed in 2017, but after undertaking work with the GLAA we wanted a code to be launched when a clear process of reporting has been developed.  Continuously engage with the GLAA to provide and develop training that is specific to our business during 2018 / 2019.  Implement an online training tool for all employees to allow them to understand that Modern Slavery is a risk within hospitality.
Carry out risk assessments and monitor our supplier tiers and carry out audits. BOARD APPROVAL This statement has been approved by the Board of VUR Village Trading No.1 Limited and the Board of VUR Holdings (UK) Limited and is signed by Gary Davis as Director of VUR Village Trading No.1 Limited.

Section 54 Modern Slavery Act Statement
For the Financial Year 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016
1. Introduction
Workspace Group plc (“Workspace”) is committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner. In particular, Workspace will not tolerate slavery and human trafficking and applauds efforts being made globally to eliminate such practices. Workspace expects its suppliers, contractors and service providers (‘Suppliers’) to also support such practices.
This Statement sets out a summary of the steps Workspace is currently taking to help prevent slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chain. It is published in accordance with the reporting obligation in the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Notwithstanding the steps Workspace is already taking to help prevent slavery and human trafficking, Workspace views the steps being taken as an evolving process and will continue to monitor and review its risk profile and the steps being taken to improve and strengthen its practices.
2. Organisational structure, business and supply chains Total Emissions
Workspace is a FTSE 250 Real Estate Investment Trust which owns over 65 properties across approximately 4m sq. ft. in London. Workspace provides a home to some 4,000 New and Growing Companies, creating communities of entrepreneurs and fast growing companies in our business centres and giving customers what they need to help them grow.
Our business is predominately within the UK and accordingly our geographic risk of slavery and human trafficking is considered to be low. We see our main sector risks as being construction, food and drink and security, cleaning and maintenance. We contract with a number of suppliers in these sectors.
3. Policies and Training
To help prevent modern slavery or human trafficking in our business and supply chains we have adopted an Anti-slavery Policy which reflects our position on the issue. Our Anti-slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity and to implementing effective systems and controls to help ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business and supply chains. We will monitor and update the policy as necessary.
We expect all of our Suppliers to comply with our Anti-slavery Policy and a copy of the policy has been sent to our Suppliers following its launch.
The Policy also applies to all of our employees and to ensure proper understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking, we provide training to relevant members of staff on the policy. All directors have also been briefed on the subject.
4. Suppliers Due Diligence
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person's liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. Workspace expects all of its suppliers, contractors and service providers to act

ethically and with integrity and to have in place effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in their own business or in any of their supply chains.
We have implemented the following safeguards with our suppliers:
1. Due diligence – Before a new supplier, contractor or service provider is approved, Workspace will carry out appropriate due diligence on the supplier, including requiring the supplier to submit an “Approved Contractor & Supplier Application Form”. As part of this process, Workspace will review the supplier’s policies and systems on anti-slavery and human trafficking. Where a supplier does not provide a copy of their policy, then a copy of the Workspace anti-slavery and human trafficking policy will be made available to them. New suppliers will only become approved suppliers once Workspace has completed its due diligence.
2. Workspace Policies – Workspace has put in place a Supplier Code of Conduct and an AntiSlavery and Human Trafficking Policy. These policies set out Workspace’s expectations of its suppliers, including in relation to anti-slavery and human trafficking. Suppliers are expected to adhere to these policies. Workspace also has rights to carry out audits to ensure compliance and the right to require periodic certification on compliance.
3. Contractual Measures – For our material suppliers, Workspace will endeavour to include contractual clauses within its agreement with the supplier placing contractual obligations on the supplier to ensure it and its own suppliers comply with the law on anti-slavery and human trafficking. Workspace will also endeavour to seek appropriate rights to audit suppliers to ensure compliance.
4. Breaches – Workspace will view any breaches by a supplier of Workspace’s policies or the supplier’s contractual commitments very seriously. Breaches may result in Workspace requiring an immediate remediation plan. Workspace may also terminate its relationship with any supplier that is in breach or fails to cooperate with remedying a breach.
We will continue to monitor the above safeguards and consider implementing further measures as required.

MACDONALD HOTELS LIMITED
MODERN SLAVERY ACT TRANSPARENCY STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION
This is the Modern Slavery Transparency Statement of Macdonald Hotels Limited (""Macdonald Hotels"") for the financial year ending 31st March 2018. This statement is made pursuant to s.54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Macdonald Hotels is committed to operating with integrity and accountability. That commitment applies both within the organisation and in our relationships with suppliers.
We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking. We are committed to taking all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not present
either in our operations or supply chains.
Macdonald Hotels recognises that slavery and human trafficking are not issues which are confined to the overseas hospitality sector. In particular we recognise and are assessing the risks that arise from the use of foreign and migrant labour, and from supply chains both in the UK and
overseas.
ABOUT MACDONALD HOTELS
Our business
The Macdonald Hotels group is one of the UK's leading privately owned hotel and hospitality businesses. This Statement is made in respect of the operations of Macdonald Hotels Limited.
Macdonald Hotels is headquartered in Bathgate, Scotland.
The group consists of over 40 hotels and resorts in the UK, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal. The focus of our business is people, and our responsibility begins with the way we treat our staff and invest in their potential through training and personal development. The business relies on the services of around 4,000 workers spanning food and beverage operations; housekeeping; guest service operations; kitchen operations and recreational operations. We also have employees in commercial and finance operations; hotel operations (including hotel general managers) and in
administration, IT and HR roles.
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Macdonald Hotels has an existing compliance programme comprising policies, procedures and requirements for employees, suppliers and hotels in relation to human rights, ethical practices and modern slavery. This includes robust checks and verification in respect of migrant workers;
a whistleblowing policy to encourage reports from staff of unethical conduct; and a central register of recruitment agents and supplier contracts. We only work with trusted agents and suppliers and we require all potential employees to provide evidence of entitlement to work in
the UK.
In direct response to the risk of slavery and human trafficking, Macdonald Hotels has built on its existing compliance framework by:
Updating our Whistleblowing policy to ensure coverage of suspected slavery and human trafficking incidents
Implementing an Anti-Slavery Policy Issuing our Anti-Slavery Policy to our suppliers and recruitment agencies Taking external legal advice on the application of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 to our business Communicating our senior management team's strong support for the aims of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and our zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking Conducting a risk assessment of our business and our supply chains (as detailed below) Identifying Key Performance Indicators against which to assess our progress in managing the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our business and our supply chains (as detailed further
below DUE DILIGENCE IN OUR SUPPLY CHAINS
As part of our zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking, Macdonald Hotels will only work with those who provide assurances on their working practices and commitment to combating slavery and human trafficking in their own businesses and supply chains.
We endeavour to conduct regular Risk Assessments of our supply chains. Where we identify suppliers to be ""at risk"" of slavery and human trafficking we will seek compliance assurances from them; exercise right to terminate early for failure to comply with applicable laws and our
Anti Slavery Policy etc
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (""KPIs"")
We will use the following KPIs to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business or supply chains:
Any and all incidents or complaints of slavery and human trafficking reported to the Legal Department, whether under our Whistleblowing Policy or otherwise, are investigated within 24
hours Monitoring the response rate of ""at risk"" suppliers to our request that they advise us on the steps
taken to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their business or supply chains
Numbers of staff trained on our Anti-Slavery Policy and updated Whistleblowing Policy;

Remedial action taken following non-compliances found during audits FUTURE STEPS
Macdonald Hotels believes in increased transparency in how businesses are playing their part in preventing slavery and human trafficking. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our compliance programme and take necessary steps to address any instances of slavery and human trafficking on an ongoing basis. We will publish an updated Modern Slavery Act Transparency

This statement sets out what we have done to ensure that slavery and trafficking are not taking place in any part of our business and that human rights are respected. The ED&F Man Group welcomes the UK Modern Slavery Act and the responsibility it places on businesses to disclose publicly the steps they are taking to tackle forced labour and human trafficking. ED&F Man supports the UN Convention on Human Rights and is committed to transparency in its supply chains and business operations. This statement is made as part of the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015. ED&F Man’s board has approved this statement for the financial year starting in October 2017 and ending September 2018. It is signed on the board’s behalf by Rafael Muguiro, Group Executive Chairman.
Main developments
2017–18

Our coffee business in Uganda has been presented with a Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Standard-Setter Award for its farmer support programme and ‘Stop child labour’ project in the West Nile. ED&F Man is an active participant on the Bonsucro Smallholder Advisory Committee, which aims to make compliance work for vulnerable participants in the sugarcane supply chain, and the Buyer Accelerator Group, which seeks to accelerate the pace and impact of improvement in sustainable sugarcane production and supply (in relation to human & labour rights, smallholder improvement, economic resilience and environmental stewardship).
The Managing Director of ED&F Man’s coffee business has joined the board of the Global Coffee Platform, which addresses issues such as gender inequity and economic viability in coffee growing origins.
2016–17
Bonsucro awarded ED&F Man a multi-site certification for sustainability practices and confirmed our Sugar and Liquid Products business use sustainable and ethical practices.
We drafted and approved a new Supplier Code of Conduct, which we sent to existing suppliers; we now send this to new suppliers to sign as part of our approvals process.
Our business
ED&F Man is a global agricultural commodities merchant and processor. We trade sugar, coffee, molasses, grains, pulses and animal feed – and provide access to commodity and capital markets through our brokerage business. We are a majority employee-owned company. We employ over 7,000 staff in around 60 countries. Read our Standards of Business Conduct
Our policies
Human rights
Our group-wide CSR policy supports the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As a Group we commit that: All employees are employed of their own free will. Local communities can express their concerns to the company. We do not tolerate or condone human-rights abuses. We do not tolerate or condone corporal punishment or physical oppression. When we rely on security staff, we have appropriate standards of conduct and controls in place for them. We allow freedom of association - a person’s right to join or leave a group - and collective bargaining - a group of employees’ right to negotiate wages and employment terms.
Read our CSR policy

Labour standards
We support the principles of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO’s) Declaration of Philadelphia that labour is not a commodity. As a Group we commit to:
Comply with the national labour laws of all countries in which we operate. Pay at least local minimum wages. Provide clear terms of employment. Ensure working hours are reasonable and comply with national working-time regulations. Develop employees’ skills through training. Ensure there is an effective grievance procedure available to employees.
Child labour
We respect the ILO convention on child labour and children’s right to an education, and support ending harmful child labour. As such, we:
Make sure people under 18 are employed only in compliance with local law, UN guidelines and ILO conventions: They may only perform ‘light work’. They must be properly supervised. Their work must not interfere with their health or moral development.
Will not employ children under the age of 15.
Our supply chains
We are confident there is no slavery or human trafficking in our directly managed organisation. As an agricultural commodities company that works extensively with partners, suppliers and customers across the world, parts of our supply networks could pose risks - particularly in places with large migrant or displaced populations, or unstable regions where vulnerable people could be at risk. We work closely with suppliers to uphold proper practices in our supply chains, and inform our suppliers of ED&F Man and our customers’ sourcing standards. We expect our suppliers to comply with our standards and to share our commitment to ethical business conduct including signing and adhering to our Supplier Code of Conduct. Read our Supplier Code of Conduct
Our Supplier Code of Conduct makes it clear that ‘worker fees’ - when workers pay employment agencies to get jobs are not acceptable. We work to ensure this practice is neither introduced nor tolerated and will work with the relevant local authorities to address any misconduct. To identify and mitigate the risk of forced labour in our supply chains, we train producers and partners, including smallholders and their families, in best practices. For example, our coffee origin teams include over 200 field technicians and agronomists who help 36,000 coffee producers improve working conditions, achieve profitability and raise quality and safety standards. We reserve the right to have third-party auditors check our suppliers’ standards. When adding new suppliers, we evaluate their ethical and sustainable practices as part of the supplier evaluation and acceptance procedure. When breaches to social, ethical or labour standards are reported up the agricultural supply chain we will investigate and enter into dialogue with suppliers involved. If such claims are confirmed, we will take

necessary action which may include ending agreements with suppliers who abuse labour standards or violate our Supplier Code of Conduct.
Certifications
External certification bodies regularly visit our trading and asset operations to check our certificates and adherence to standards. These bodies include:
Control Union SGS Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Kiwa PAI Validus Our Shipping Division complies with the Maritime Labour Convention, which has set minimum age requirements and standards for employment and working conditions on ships. The Shipping Division also makes sure its partners and contractors meet the International Transport Workers’ Federation requirements, or the local country’s equivalent. Our Fish Oil business is certified under the International Fish Oil and Fish Meal Organisation's responsible sourcing scheme. Read our responsible sourcing certificate for fish oil
As a founder member of Bonsucro - originally known as the Better Sugarcane Initiative - we are helping set measureable social and environmental standards for producing sugarcane. In 2016 Bonsucro awarded ED&F Man a multi-site certification for adherence to sustainable practices for both our sugar and molasses businesses. Independent certification bodies audited our activities, processes and documents for compliance to this standard, resulting in Bonsucro certification of our London, Singapore, Miami, Amsterdam, New Orleans and Mexico trading offices, and our operational assets including:
Singapore (SIS'88 and Asian Blending) Ukraine (USC) The Czech Republic (Man Ingredients) India (Uniworld) Israel (Sugat) The certification recognises our commitment to source sugar from certified suppliers that demonstrate sustainable farming and production practices. Read our Bonsucro certification for sustainable practices
Read our Bonsucro certification for molasses Our Coffee business, Volcafe, develops and operates certified and verified supply chains across all our origins. These include the Global Coffee Platform (4C), UTZ Certified, Rainforest Alliance, Nespresso AAA, Cafe Practices and a range of customer codes of conduct. FLO-CERT, the independent certification body that checks products and supply chains practices against Fairtrade standards has said that Volcafe meets the following Fairtrade standards: Trader – Payer
Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organisations

And the following FLO-CERT certification requirement: Trader – Payer
FLO-CERT Public Compliance Criteria List – Trade Certification Read our FLO-CERT certificate for supply chain practices Volcafe is UTZ-certified, which guarantees that our coffee is traceable from producer to roaster, and our products have been grown and harvested in a responsible manner.

102,"Winton Transparency Statement on Modern Slavery
31 December 2018
Introduction and purpose of this statement
This statement is made by Winton Group Limited (“WGL”) and other relevant group companies (together, “Winton”) and is published pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”).
Winton is a global investment management and data science firm. The Winton group parent company, WGL, is a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales. Winton Capital Management Limited (“WCM”) and Winton Fund Management Limited (“WFM”) perform investment management functions. WCM and WFM are limited liability companies incorporated in England and Wales and are wholly-owned by WGL. WCM and WFM are authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority.
This statement outlines the steps that Winton has taken to detect and prevent modern slavery during the financial year ended 31 December 2018 and the following period prior to publication of this statement. This statement will be reviewed and, where required, updated annually. This statement applies to relevant entities in the Winton group.
The Winton approach to slavery and human trafficking
It is Winton’s policy not to tolerate modern slavery, servitude, forced labour or human trafficking as contemplated by the Act (“Modern Slavery”) within its business activities, employment arrangements or supply chains.
Winton’s supply chain
Due to the nature of its business, Winton has a limited supply chain. Accordingly, the risk of Modern Slavery in Winton’s business is relatively low when compared to businesses which produce or sell physical goods.
Winton’s direct supply chain is limited and includes, for example, financial data providers. Winton uses a number of third party suppliers in its indirect supply chain in relation to non-core functions such as cleaning, catering, office services and branding.

Supply chain audit and due diligence
Winton has applied a risk-based approach in its supply chain audit. In particular, it has reviewed the supply arrangements that are considered to pose the highest risk of Modern Slavery, taking into account qualitative factors including particular industry or sector risk, business partner risk and geographical risk. As part of this risk assessment, Winton also conducted research in order to determine which suppliers are directly bound by the Act and, where relevant, requested other evidence of compliance such as copies of relevant certifications and policies.
Steps taken
Any relevant supplier within scope is sent a letter informing it of Winton’s zero tolerance policy towards Modern Slavery. Winton’s approach is to consider terminating or not renewing any contract with any high risk supplier that is unable to make a declaration of compliance or which provides unsatisfactory evidence of compliance. Winton has trained staff on the anti-Modern Slavery framework and detection measures.
Winton’s supplier onboarding process includes requests for information about measures taken by suppliers to address the risk of Modern Slavery. Where appropriate, this includes reviewing modern slavery statements made by suppliers and asking new suppliers to confirm that they take steps to prevent and address Modern Slavery in their business and supply chains. Arrangements with suppliers and service providers are subject to ongoing review.
Working for Winton
Winton has over 250 employees and a number of independent contractors and consultants who perform business and non-core functions. The majority of staff employed or engaged by Winton carry out highly-skilled activities and therefore the risk of these workers being subject to Modern Slavery is relatively low.
Furthermore, Winton promotes high standards of health and safety at work and does not tolerate Modern Slavery in its recruitment or employment arrangements. Winton’s staff are protected by relevant laws and regulations, which are fully reflected in Winton’s policies and procedures. Winton’s standard terms with recruitment firms include contractual protections to address the risk of Modern Slavery.

Existing policies
Winton maintains the following policies which it believes are relevant in the detection and prevention of Modern Slavery:
•   vendor management policy and procedures; •   corporate social responsibility policy; •   code of ethics; •   anti-bribery and sanctions policies; •   internal escalation and whistleblowing policy; and •   anti-money laundering policy.
Assessment of effectiveness in preventing Modern Slavery
The risk of Modern Slavery is expected to fluctuate over time. Winton will use the following key performance indicators to assess effectiveness of its anti-modern slavery processes and procedures on an ongoing basis:
•   staff training levels; •   the onboarding procedures, information requests and contractual terms aimed at ensuring
the detection and mitigation of Modern Slavery; and •   any remedial action taken in response to a report or suspected case of Modern Slavery.
Approval
This statement has been approved by Brigid Rentoul in her capacity as a director of Winton Group Limited.

4. Activities
In the MS & AD Group Medium-Term Management Plan ""Vision 2021"" that began in April 2018, we set forth
the goal of ""a resilient and sustainable society"" as its image of society in 2030 and we tackle the challenge of
creating shared values using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as milestones. We have set up
""activities and dialogue that respect human rights"" as a basic approach and we are promoting efforts to respect
human rights.
(1) Human rights due diligence
The Group identified and assessed human rights risks that surround the Group considering the nature of our
business. As a result, the Group took as priority issues the physical and mental effects of employees' long
hours of work and the infringement of privacy arising from the leakage of personal information of
customers, etc. We conduct periodical monitoring on such priority issues and take actions to mitigate the
risks. We also identified related activities with foreign technical interns, and conducted interviews with
related business divisions in the Group. At the time of the interview, we did not see any apparent
problematic cases.
(2) Following ""Healthy Company"" practices
The Group believes that having healthy employees is vital for putting its Mission Statement into practice,
and strives to create a safe, pleasant workplace environment.
(3) Decision-making process in investment and underwriting activities
In June 2015, the Group signed the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), and we are working to
advance investment initiatives with ESG in mind. In fiscal 2018, we addressed that we consider ESG factors
associated with all of our business transactions including underwriting as well as investment, and we are
reviewing the processes of implementation.
(4) Training and educational activities
The Group conducts workplace training in human rights for all employees based on a common text. Each
Group company also works to raise employee awareness of respect for human rights by providing
self-directed e-learning, as well as programming dedicated sessions in rank-based trainings such as those for
promoted employees and for managers. Even at conference for compliance controllers of overseas bases, we
also worked to enhance their understanding of the Group Human Rights Basic Policy.
(5) Speak-up systems(Whistle blowing systems)
To ensure action is taken to secure respect for the human rights and a positive workplace environment by its
officers and employees, and to take the appropriate steps when necessary, the Group has established a
system by which employees can report human rights and other issues to either an internal person in charge
or directly to an outside specialist.
In fiscal 2018, we continuously conducted a survey of awareness about the system for all employees in
Japan and overseas, in order to publicize and improve the system within the Group.
Main items subject to reporting
Compliance-related issues
Employee mental, physical and health issues due to harassment
Working hours, overtime and other issues related to the workplace environment

105,"Modern Slavery Statement
This statement outlines our actions and activities regarding efforts to combat slavery and human trafficking within our business and supply chain during the period January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.
Wyndham Worldwide Business and Culture
Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (“Wyndham Worldwide”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is one of the largest global hospitality companies, providing travelers with access to a collection of trusted hospitality brands. With a collective inventory of nearly 130,000 places to stay across more than 110 countries on six continents, Wyndham Worldwide and its 38,000 employees welcome people to experience travel the way they want. Our diverse portfolio transcends multiple hospitality and lodging segments. Wyndham Hotel Group (“WHG”) includes hotel franchising and management across 15 brands and offers more than 8,000 hotels in 80 countries. Wyndham Destination Network offers more than 121,000 properties of professionally managed, unique vacation accommodations – from houseboats and cottages to rental homes and timeshare resorts in more than 110 countries. Wyndham Vacation Ownership has 219 vacation ownership resorts throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and the South Pacific and has nearly 900,000 owner families worldwide. Our supply chain covers procurement at the corporate, business unit and local levels. The Company has a dedicated Worldwide Sourcing Solutions, Inc. (“WSSI”) group that partners with suppliers and strives to offer our collective businesses products and services at the best possible value and price. We have developed a risk-based approach to report, manage and roll out programs intended to combat slavery and human trafficking in areas where we believe there is a high risk of such activity and where we have operational control over the business and our supply chain. Given the nature of the hotel business with its risks for human trafficking activity, the Company has focused its anti-human trafficking efforts primarily within WHG and certain global suppliers of our WSSI group. We will continue to work with our businesses to monitor, refine and implement programs.
Ranked among the World’s Most Ethical Companies, Wyndham Worldwide has publicly acknowledged our commitment to operate our business in a manner consistent with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Global Compact since 2007 when Wyndham Worldwide first published The Company’s Human Rights Policy Statement. This is reflective of the Company’s core values, culture of ethical business practices and commitment to corporate social responsibility.
Policies. Wyndham Worldwide has in place policies to help eliminate the potential use of Wyndham properties for slavery and human trafficking. Wyndham Worldwide’s Business Principles represent the core of our business philosophy requiring our employees to act both ethically and legally when dealing with fellow employees and third parties with whom we do business. In addition, as mentioned above, Wyndham Worldwide also abides by our Human Rights Policy Statement, reflecting our commitment to protect human rights within our sphere of influence. In furtherance of this commitment, in 2011, we became one of the first hotel companies to take a stand against the commercial sexual exploitation of children by signing the Tourism Child-Protection Code of Conduct (“The Code”). Wyndham Worldwide also expects our suppliers to act in a compliant and ethical manner and as such, we ask our suppliers to meet the criteria established in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which, among other things, sets forth the Company’s expectations of its suppliers with respect to forced labor and child hiring practices.
Risk Management. Wyndham Worldwide also has in place processes to help eliminate the potential use of Wyndham properties for slavery and human trafficking. The Company’s work on human rights is overseen by the Corporate Social Responsibility Council, which is comprised of senior leaders across our businesses. It includes a Human Rights Working Group that identifies and educates employees and suppliers, and works in partnership with key stakeholders to implement solutions. The Company encourages its employees and suppliers (where permitted by law) to report certain matters confidentially or anonymously through its third party whistleblower hotline without fear of retaliation, including circumstances that may give rise to slavery or human trafficking concerns. In addition, for our WHG operations in North America, we make available a third party hotline, operated by Polaris, whereby employees of our WHG managed hotel properties can consult with experts who will help them identify suspected signs of slavery and human trafficking and report such matters to the authorities. Moreover, globally, WHG distributes information at our owned and managed hotel properties that assists

employees with identifying potential signs of slavery and human trafficking and provides a process for timely escalating concerns within the organization.
Supply Chain. As a global hospitality company, we purchase services and products all over the world. These include but are not limited to services related to cleaning, maintenance and consulting as well as products such as food and beverages, operating supplies, furniture, fixtures and equipment. We take a risk-based approach to performing due diligence on our WSSI suppliers, which includes reviewing suppliers doing business in high-risk countries or offering high-risk products or services. Based upon this risk, certain WSSI approved suppliers have completed a Human Rights Supplier Survey and we conduct due diligence on certain of our existing and prospective WSSI suppliers on an ongoing basis. To the extent a WSSI supplier does not meet our due diligence requirements or our standards for ethical conduct as outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct, we will not do business with that supplier.
Training. The Company requires employees to attend training on its Business Principles. Compliance with this training requirement is monitored. In addition, Wyndham Worldwide has introduced training to our WHG employees at our owned and managed hotel properties relating to slavery and human trafficking. Moreover, our new hire orientation includes education about Corporate Social Responsibility and our Human Rights program. In addition, Wyndham Worldwide makes a reasonable effort to positively influence parties over which we do not have operational control. We have provided training and education about child labor and human trafficking to our WHG franchised operations through webinars, seminars at our global hotel conferences and online portals, and provided educational materials to our WSSI suppliers on slavery and human trafficking. In 2016, we rolled out training sessions to our WHG managed and owned hotel properties in the U.S., as well as to our managed hotel properties in Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Further as part of our ongoing Business Continuity Plan Emergency Preparedness Guide and Training, we include checklists, escalation protocols and information to assist our property management staff in identifying the key warning signs of human trafficking and guidance on how to report cases.
Community and Stakeholder Partnerships. The Company collaborates and works with organizations to identify risks and develop best practices and solutions to this issue. In partnership with Polaris and the American Hotel & Lodging Association’s Educational Institute we co-developed and launched one of the first hotel human trafficking videos and corresponding training materials, which is available for use by over 25,000 hotels globally throughout the industry. Over the past four years, in conjunction with International Tourism Partnership we conducted internal and external stakeholder surveys and meetings to develop industry assessments and solutions. This has included the industry statement on Human Trafficking and materials such as Guidelines for Checking Recruitment Agencies; and Factsheets on the UK Modern Slavery Act. We also work with ECPAT-USA, which administers The Code, to annually report our progress on our commitment to training our WHG hotel associates and properties, to identify and report cases, and to raise awareness among our WHG hotel business partners and customers. We are proud that many of our hotel guests have this same commitment, demonstrated by their donation of over 2 million Wyndham Rewards guest loyalty points for safe stays for human trafficking victims. Additionally, we have worked with Sabre Corporation, a global technology and distribution provider, to launch the Passport to Freedom program, which is the first-ever educational scholarship for human trafficking survivors.
Key Performance Indicators. Wyndham Worldwide will continue to track a number of key performance indicators relative to its initiatives to combat slavery and human trafficking. In our Corporate Social Responsibility Report, we publish annually the results of our programs including regarding human rights. This includes a description of our policies, education and training as well as guest and stakeholder engagement. We also track key metrics relative to slavery and human trafficking that include training, education, assessments and reporting.
Looking forward, we plan to maintain our commitment to combatting slavery and human trafficking by continuing to develop resources, refine our goals, and educate our employees and stakeholders across relevant areas of our business and supply chain. This is an ongoing process and to that end, we aspire to continue to work with the industry to make an impact within our sphere of influence.
This statement has been reviewed and approved by the Wyndham Worldwide Board of Directors.

Modern slavery and human trafficking
Our strong values and code of ethics mean we will not use any business or organisation which is involved in this activity
Home / Slavery and human trafficking statement
Barnett Waddingham welcomes the UK’s Modern Slavery Act and the duty it places on businesses to disclose publicly the steps they are taking to tackle forced labour and human trafficking. Our strong values and code of ethics mean we will not use any business or organisation which is involved in this activity.
We are an independent professional services firm within the financial services sector, providing actuarial, administration and consultancy services. We have over 1,200 employees and partners within eight offices nationwide.
Policy statement We are committed to ensuring that within our control there are no breaches appertaining to section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act and will not use or allow the use of forced, compulsory labour, slavery or human trafficking in the course of our business activities either in our supply chain or in any part of our business. This will be achieved by:

Annual Modern Slavery Statement as at 31 December 2018
Slavery and human trafficking is unacceptable. We all have a responsibility to
be alert to the risks in our business and in the wider supply chain. At National
Bank of Kuwait (International) PLC (""NBKI"", ""the Bank"" or ""we""), we are
committed to playing our role in the global response to modern slavery, ensuring
that we pay our employees more than the legal minimum wage and that we
maintain and enforce proportionate systems and controls which seek to ensure
slavery and human trafficking does not take place in our supply chain.
As part of operating a successful business, we seek to ensure that we comply
with all relevant laws and regulations.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act
2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the
current financial year. It has been approved by the NBKI Board of Directors on
25 July 2019 and sets out the steps we have taken to prevent slavery and
human trafficking from taking place in our supply chains and in our own business
Organisational structure, policies and supply chains
NBKI provides a range of commercial banking services to individuals as well as
business clients from its London headquarters. The Bank is authorised by the
Prudential Regulatory Authority (""PRA"") and regulated by the PRA and Financial
Conduct Authority (""FCA""). The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of National
Bank of Kuwait SAKP, which is incorporated in Kuwait. At the end of the year the
branch of the Bank located in Paris was converted to a direct subsidiary of the
group company National Bank of Kuwait SAKP.
As of 31 December 2018, NBKI employs 134 members of staff on a permanent
basis. Additionally, 16 positions are filled by outsourced staff. The Bank procures
goods and services from approximately 150 vendors in the UK and abroad. We
are committed to taking reasonable steps to try and establish that key suppliers
are compliant with anti-slavery and anti-trafficking practices. Where it becomes
apparent to us that they are not, we will discontinue the business relationship.
We are committed to high ethical standards, as established throughout our
internal policies. Our procurement policies cover the due diligence of the vendor
selection and management process.
We work to combat any form of modern slavery in our business and supply
chains. Accordingly, we are in the process of updating our Code of Conduct
Policy to include a section on Anti-Slavery, which is due to be implemented by
We operate a Whistleblowing Policy to encourage staff to raise any concerns of
wrongdoing through a confidential escalation pathway. This allows employees to
be confident that NBKI does not tolerate any unfair discriminatory treatment or
victimisation. We adopt an equal opportunities policy as part of our Staff
Handbook to ensure that every individual is treated fairly and with due respect
and dignity within the organisation.
Risk assessment and due diligence
Whilst we consider there to be a low risk of slavery in our business, we will
assess and document our exposure to modern slavery risk by 31 December 2019
and put in place enhancements to our outsourcing policies and procedures which
seek to ensure that vendors are not facilitating human rights abuses.
The Bank has not currently identified any instances of modern slavery or human
trafficking, nor has it had to address any labour rights abuses or company level
grievances in relation to slavery or human trafficking. The Bank will make
reasonable efforts to identify instances of slavery, but does not intend to put in
place performance indicators given the nature of our business and our relatively
small size in terms of banks generally.
To keep our staff aware and up to date about our obligations under the Modern
Slavery Act, we will arrange training and the distribution of policy circulars
across the Bank in 2019.

News & MIt iesdthiae policy of Huntington Ingalls Industries to maintain the highest standards of honesty, integrity and trust in all aspects of its business and
to meet all of its responsibilities to its customers, employees, shareholders, and to the nation. Consistent with this policy, Huntington Ingalls
IInndvuesstrtoiersRsueplaptoiortns sunequivocally the elimination of human trafficking and slavery.
Huntington Ingalls Industries’ primary business is the design, construction, repair and maintenance of nuclear-powered ships, such as aircraft carriers and submarines, and non-nuclear ships, such as surface combatants, expeditionary warfare/amphibious assault and coastal defense surface ships, as well as the overhaul and refueling of nuclear-powered ships. In 2014, nearly all of our revenues were generated by subsidiaries performing contracts for the U.S. Government.
Subsidiaries of Huntington Ingalls Industries and its suppliers that perform U.S. Government contracts must comply with 48 CFR § 52.222-50, “Combating Trafficking in Persons.” 48 CFR § 52.222-50 implements the U.S. Government’s “zero tolerance policy on human trafficking” by prohibiting prime contractors and their subcontractors at any tier from utilizing “forced labor” or engaging in “severe forms of trafficking in persons” during the performance of our contracts and the subcontracts awarded thereunder.
Huntington Ingalls Industries is required to and does include 48 CFR § 52.222-50 in all subcontracts placed in support of our Government business. Violations of 48 CFR § 52.222-50 can result in substantial financial and other penalties to include contract and subcontract termination and debarment from U.S. Government work.
Huntington Ingalls Industries is also committed to complying with the U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015. Amongst other things, the U.K. Modern Slavery Act requires companies to publicly disclose the steps they have taken in the past financial year to ensure that modern-day slavery and human trafficking are not taking place within their own business or within any part of their supply chain.
Huntington Ingalls Industries takes several steps to ensure that we meet these ethical and legal obligations. First, we maintain a corporate procedure based on 48 CFR § 52.222-50 that seeks to educate our employees and ensure that they do not engage in human trafficking and forced labor practices. Any Huntington Ingalls Industries employee who violates this procedure is subject to discipline, up to and including termination.
Second, direct suppliers of Huntington Ingalls Industries are also required not only to comply with applicable laws and regulations in providing us goods and services, but also to adhere to HII’s values and standards of business conduct. We provide these values and standards to our suppliers in a “Business Associates Brochure,” which is available on our website. Huntington Ingalls Industries does not, however, view human trafficking and slavery solely as a legal issue. Instead, we see it as a broader ethical obligation for everyone who represents Huntington Ingalls Industries, whether it be one of our employees or a supplier. Suppliers who fail to adhere to our standards are subject to termination. Huntington Ingalls Industries suppliers and employees have access to a toll free open-line that enables them to raise questions and concerns and report violations of laws, regulations and our standards of conduct.
Third, Huntington Ingalls Industries believes that the highly regulated nature of our Government business minimizes the risk of human trafficking and slavery within our direct supplier base. In keeping with our commitment to ethics, integrity and corporate governance, Huntington Ingalls Industries maintains broad-based supply chain programs, practices and procedures. Our goal is to ensure that our suppliers meet our strong ethical standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations and our contractual commitments to the U.S. Government, which include those governing human trafficking and forced labor. Our supply chain processes often involve inspections at our direct supplier’s facilities by either our supplier quality organizations or the U.S. Government.
Huntington Ingalls Industries is also in the process of evaluating the development of training for employees to ensure that they are aware of the Company’s policies regarding human trafficking and slavery and the various safeguards that Huntington Ingalls Industries has implemented in order to prevent these activities.

Finally, in addition to the items described above – many of which are focused specifically on human trafficking and forced labor – Huntington Ingalls Industries maintains a robust, broad-based ethics and compliance program that stresses values, leadership, training, audits, inspections, certifications and accountability. This broad-based program is intended to ensure that Huntington Ingalls Industries complies with all applicable laws and maintains a culture committed to ethics and integrity.

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT – MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015
This statement is made pursuant to S.54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the requirement for certain businesses to provide disclosure concerning their efforts to address issues of modern slavery and human trafficking in their own operations and in their supply chain.
Executive Summary
Donnelley Financial Solutions Inc (DFIN) is a global service provider and accordingly has a duty to operate its business in an ethical fair and responsible manner. DFIN operates an information technology and service based business and considers that the risk that any form of bonded labour, child labour, forced labour, slavery, trafficking or workplace (“Modern Slavery and Related Human Rights Abuses”) abuse exists within its supply chain is low.
Donnelley Financial Solutions UK Limited (“DFIN UK”) is 100% beneficially owned by DFIN and has its business primarily based in the UK and Europe, as an employer and as a part of each of the communities in which our sites are located, that the expectations upon us are changing in line with the increased global focus on the role of business within Modern Slavery and Related Human Rights Abuses. DFIN UK is evolving its approach to engage with this changing landscape of corporate responsibility and the new reality of supply chain awareness. DFIN UK is continually reviewing its policies and procedures to take all steps necessary to prevent the risk of Modern Slavery and Human Rights Abuses occurring in its business.
Structure, business and supply chains
Eradicating Modern Slavery and Related Human Rights Abuses in our supply chain is essentially our suppliers’ responsibility however DFIN has undertaken the following actions:
i. Strategic Approach: DFIN’s long term strategic goals include: Identifying High Risk Areas for Modern Slavery and Human Rights Abuses in its supply chain; Commit to contracting with its customers in an ethical manner that seeks (where applicable) to include appropriate measures to prevent Modern Slavery or Human Rights Abuses; Develop a lasting corporate and legacy on DFIN zero tolerance policy to Modern Slavery and Human Rights Abuses; Develop an engaging staff training programme on the impact of the Modern Slavery Act. Develop a Code of Conduct for its suppliers to adhere to – to reflect the core ethical principles shares by DFIN and its business.
ii. Audit: DFIN will continue to develop its policy on Modern Slavery, which is currently reviewed throughout the year and with policies updated on an annual basis.
iii. Due Diligence: In our assessment of risk we will consider the nature of the risk, severity of the risk, the level of influence a business may have over its own supply base and the level of influence which may be interpreted that DFIN may have over that supplier.
iv. Self Assessment: Through our internal assessment, we are looking at varied ways to assess risk through specific country risks, sector risks, transaction risks and business partnership risks.
v. Contractual Review: DFIN has reviewed its contractual documentation in order to fully understand its process of identifying and stopping any Modern Slavery and Related Human Rights Issues, giving particular consideration to where applicable: Principles of Ethical Conduct of its customers and suppliers; and the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (in so far as it applies to the suppliers).
vi. Remedies; Dealing with Infractions: DFIN UK will monitor any supplier it reasonably suspects of committing Modern Slavery and Human Rights Abuses and contact the supplier to further understand and investigate any potential violations. DFIN UK will work with the supplier to remedy the breach if it believes that it is capable of remedy. DFIN UK has incorporated robust termination rights into its contracts (with suppliers and customers) in order to terminate contracts where Modern Slavery and Human Rights Abuses are committed.
vii. Training: DFIN UK has reviewed its training modules and now has a mandatory training module for all new employees that join the company, and periodic training to all current employees who may have to give consideration to Modern Slavery Act 2015 and will be required to identity potential circumstances where Modern Slavery and Related Human Rights Abuses may exist.
viii. Senior Sponsorship: Due to the low risk of Modern Slavery and Related Human Rights Abuses that DFIN has determined exists in its supply chain, DFIN UK will continue to review its position with a view to evolving its policy on the Modern Slavery Act and to involve a proactive role of employees and senior managers within the company. Meetings with senior management to develop and evolve the DFIN UK policies, preventing Modern Slavery and Related Human Rights Abuses, are planned on an annual basis.
ix. Reality Check: DFIN UK aims to encourage and foster a culture of disclosure to ensure that any Modern Slavery and Human Rights Abuses are reported at the earliest opportunity.

113,"Modern Slavery Act Statement 2018
Introduction
This is Canada Life’s third statement on its approach to modern slavery following the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”). At Canada Life we recognise the importance of the Act and what it aims to achieve in combatting modern slavery, and, as a responsible business, we understand our duty to act ethically and with integrity.
This statement sets out the steps that have been taken to ensure the detection and prevention of modern slavery across Canada Life’s UK operations and supply chains, and the next steps planned for the coming financial year.
Our Business
At Canada Life, we provide retirement, investment and protection solutions to individuals, families and companies. We have 468,976 pension annuities in force, cover 2.87 million UK-based employees through our group insurance products and manage more than £37 billion of equities, fixed income and property, as well as a comprehensive multi-asset range through our investments division. Canada Life has over 1,200 employees in the UK. Canada Life sells its products to individuals and corporate entities located in the UK through professional advisers.
Canada Life is a UK-based subsidiary of the Great-West Lifeco group of companies, which has operations in Canada, the United States, Ireland, and Germany. We have been operating in the UK since 1903.
We are committed to reviewing our business operating model and processes regularly to ensure that our risk exposure to modern slavery is managed and monitored appropriately.
Our Employees
We have considered Canada Life’s internal policies and procedures in respect of preventing modern slavery from taking place anywhere within our business. Our Code of Conduct (the “Code”) requires all directors, officers and employees of Canada Life to act ethically and in accordance with our core values at all times. All directors, officers and employees are required to acknowledge compliance with the Code and complete a mandatory training module on the Code and ethical behaviour annually.
Our Employment Policy expresses our commitment to ensuring our risk exposure to modern slavery through our operations is managed and monitored appropriately.
Further, we encourage everyone, whether an employee of Canada Life or not, to use our Raising A Concern Policy and procedures to report any issues they are aware of confidentially and, if preferred, anonymously. Our Raising A Concern Policy makes it clear that any concerns, including about compliance with the Act by Canada Life or one of our suppliers, can be reported using these processes. Anyone can raise a concern either by talking to their manager or one of a large group of “designated persons”, by filing an anonymous report using a third party online portal or phone line or by speaking directly to the relevant regulatory body.
1 In this document, ‘Canada Life’ refers to The Canada Life Group (U.K.) Limited and its subsidiaries which are within the scope of the Act, namely, Canada Life Limited, CLFIS (U.K.) Limited and MGM Advantage Life Limited.
2 We use the UK government’s definition of ‘modern slavery’ from the statutory guidance (Transparency in Supply Chains), which encompasses slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour, and human trafficking.
3 In each case, as at December 2018. 1

Our Suppliers
Canada Life’s supply chain is comprised of suppliers based across the world, though the majority have all or part of their business operations in the UK. Our suppliers provide a range of products and services, including IT software, catering, cleaning, office furniture and equipment, utilities, property management and maintenance, and printing.
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. We completed a review within our internal procurement functions which identified our highest risk suppliers. Because of the nature of our business and our suppliers, our assessment showed a lower risk profile than in many other industries. To assist with supplier management, we have adopted a centralised supplier management software solution. A part of that system is conducting due diligence on prospective suppliers. We have introduced due diligence questions which obtain confirmation from prospective suppliers’ that they, their affiliates and their subcontractors comply with the Act.
To combat the risk of modern slavery occurring in our supply chain, we continue to ensure that our contractual terms include an obligation to comply with the Act. Where we learn of a breach by a supplier of our contract terms or a failure to comply with the Act, a report detailing the breach and the remedial actions to be taken will be presented to the UK Executive Management Committee.
Our Outsourcing and Supplier Management Policy reflects our continued commitment to the Act and our obligations in managing our supply chain. We have also built controls into our contract risk assessment process to identify our risk exposure to suppliers.
Our Next Steps
We are committed to the continual development of our processes and procedures to ensure that modern slavery does not take place within Canada Life or its supply chains.
We have allocated our UK Executive Management Committee with the responsibility of assessing the effectiveness of the actions taken to prevent modern slavery at Canada Life. Our UK Executive Management Committee consults and collaborates with our relevant business departments, including but not limited to, Compliance, Legal, Risk, Finance and Human Resources and will monitor the number of suppliers that we have contacted about the Act and the regularity of these communications, as well as consider further firmwide initiatives over the next year.
To assist with risk management of our suppliers, we are aiming to put in place a dedicated procurement function, which will be responsible for the tendering process, the selection of suppliers, and the due diligence carried out on those suppliers.
We also plan to raise awareness of modern slavery and Canada Life’s role in combatting it by incorporating modern slavery into our training on ethics and the Canada Life Code. On the next update of our Recruitment Policy, we will incorporate specific requirements to ensure that any worker who provides services to Canada Life through a recruitment agency is being treated in accordance with the Act and that modern slavery is not occurring within our recruitment agencies’ supply chains.
This statement is made by The Canada Life Group (U.K.) Limited on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries pursuant to section 54(1) of the Act and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2018. The directors of the Canada Life entities identified within scope as well as The Canada Life Group (U.K.) Limited Board have approved this statement.

ARDONAGH MODERN SLAVERY ACT STATEMENT
Introduction The Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) is a UK law that came into force in 2015. The Act requires commercial organisations with an annual turnover of more than £36 million to publish a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year. As a major provider of insurance broking and associated services, the Ardonagh group of companies (the “Ardonagh Group”) is fully supportive of the Act. The companies within the Ardonagh Group that fulfil the Act’s requirements to report are Autonet Insurance Services Limited, Price Forbes and Partners, Towergate Underwriting Group Limited, Paymentshield Limited and Ardonagh Services Limited but this statement sets out the steps taken during the financial year ended 31 December 2018 throughout the Ardonagh Group to combat slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains.
Our Business The Ardonagh Group brings together leading businesses in their respective fields within the insurance broking and services industry. For all or part of 2018, the Ardonagh Group comprised the following businesses: Autonet, Bishopsgate, Carole Nash, Chase Templeton, Geo Underwriting, Paymentshield, Price Forbes, Towergate and URIS Group. As a group, we provide a wide range of insurance products and services to businesses and consumers, and the legal entities that carry out insurance-related activity are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. As a group we have over 5,000 staff in our nationwide offices and most of our business is within the UK. More information about our business can be found at: www.ardonagh.com.
Our supply chains Our supply chains include business partners in the provision of insurance services such as insurance companies, brokers and distributors; and also providers of other services necessary to run our business effectively, such as IT, payroll, and facilities.
Recruitment practices We recognise the right of each employee to freedom of association, including the right to join trade unions. We ensure that we comply with employment legislation as regards child employment and we do not employ people who do not have the right to work in the UK.
Due diligence The businesses that make up the Ardonagh Group have varying processes in relation to ensuring that slavery and human trafficking risks are appropriately managed. Within Bishopsgate, Chase Templeton, Geo Underwriting, Paymentshield and Towergate, a question set and declaration regarding slavery and human trafficking has been included in the diligence carried out on all material suppliers (the “KYS”) since the beginning of 2017. Standard contractual documentation with third party suppliers require compliance with the Act. Additional tools such as tiscreport.org are also being used to check statements. During 2018, Price Forbes continued to review its supply chain to verify that its

key suppliers committed to observing best practice when it comes to slavery and human trafficking issues and compliance with the Act. Autonet and Carol Nash audited appropriate business partners’ websites to confirm that they had posted modern slavery statements. URIS Group does not fulfil the turnover requirement within the Act but has committed to adopting minimum standards in relation to the Act in 2019.
Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, staff involved in purchasing and entering into contractual arrangements on behalf of Bishopsgate, Chase Templeton, Geo Underwriting, Paymentshield and Towergate have been made aware of the provisions, requirements and importance of the Act. Price Forbes uses on line training to ensure that its staff are aware of the Act and the wider issues around slavery and human trafficking.
Further steps
As part of the rollout of our Group Policies and Business Standards it is recognised that there is a need to clearly articulate the minimum standards required to comply with the Modern Slavery Act which require to be adopted and embedded across all businesses within the Ardonagh Group. This will be done in early 2019, to ensure a consistent approach is adopted going forward.
As part of our annual review a supplier healthcheck will be completed which will include compliance with the Act.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2018.
The board of directors of the Group holding company, The Ardonagh Group Limited, approved this statement on 24th January 2019.

Modern slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced labour. Brightside Group Ltd has a zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery.

We have been operating for over 17 years and work with a panel of insurers to ensure we get the best rates available for our customers, whether they are looking for care, bike, van, home or business insurance. We operate from 3 locations within the United Kingdom, with around 500 employees. We work with a number of regulated insurers, system providers and other third parties. We are careful to ensure we do not breach and do not knowingly trade with any companies or individuals that breach the Modern Slavery Act.
Potential Risk Given the nature of our business, our board and management teams consider that there is minimal risk approximating to no risk that, either within the Brightside Group Ltd or the very limited supply chains which support our business activities, that we are in any way involved in or even tangentially supportive of, or complicit in, slavery and human trafficking or any other activities that may lead us to be in breach of the Modern Slavery Act.
Our Policies Brightside Group Ltd are committed to the operation of a number of internal policies to ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical, compliant and transparent manner. These include:

2. Recruitment Policy – We operate a robust recruitment policy, including ensuring that we have individual faceto-face interviews and conducting eligibility to work in the UK checks for all employees, to safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will.
3. Whistleblowing Policy – We operate a whistleblowing policy so that all employees know that they can raise concerns about how colleagues are being treated, or practices within our business or supply chain, without fear of reprisals.
4. Code of Business Conduct – This code explains the manner in which we behave as an organisation and how we expect our employees and suppliers to act.
Our Suppliers Brightside Group Ltd operates a supplier policy and maintains a preferred supplier list. We conduct due diligence on all new suppliers before allowing them to become a member of our preferred supplier list. This due diligence includes verification of the identity of the companies and directors that we are contracting with and careful checks with the FCA that the companies themselves comply with our mutual regulator’s requirements.
Training

To ensure that we have an understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking within our business, we have strict processes and training in place for colleagues who are authorised to enter into any form of negotiation / contractual relationships with new suppliers and third parties, to certify that no individual may enter into a new business relationship without the appropriate checks being completed.

This statement has been published in accordance with s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out steps taken by Assurant Europe1 to prevent modern slavery in any form occurring in its business or supply
chains.

Our Business

What is Modern Slavery?

Assurant Europe forms part of a global business with approximately
14,000 employees
and a market presence in 21 countries.
We have an active network
of over 1,000
suppliers across Europe.
Slavery Today
Modern Slavery
in the UK is 10 times higher than
initial estimates.2

Modern Slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking. It is a global issue, regardless of the type of economy we live in or industry we work in. In addition, given the rapid rise in global migration, modern slavery is a growing problem.
Assurant Europe has a zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery. This statement demonstrates our commitment to ensure we act ethically, with integrity and transparency in all our business dealings, and that we will continue to work to improve our systems and controls to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the business or our supply chains.
Our Business and Supply Chains
Assurant is a leading provider of housing and lifestyle solutions. We help our global clients protect and support the major purchases that consumers make, like their homes; cars; appliances; mobile phones; and consumer electronics protection. Serving more than 48 million consumers in Europe.
Partnering with global leaders including mobile operators, financial service providers, automotive dealers and retailers to allow their customers to ‘protect the things that matter most’.

UK nationals make the
biggest group
of potential victims.3

Assurant acquired The Warranty Group in 2018 who specialises in automotive extended warranty and mobile device protection programmes.
In Europe, Assurant’s Supply Chain operates in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Romania. The majority of services are contracted through third party providers. The third party services include repair of devices and automobiles; courier services (direct to customers); logistics services; data wipe; data destruction; and the purchase of devices. Devices are purchased directly from Original Equipment Manufacturers, networks and major distributors. Our wider supplier network comprises over 1000 different suppliers.

Policies and Contractual Controls
We operate a number of internal policies to ensure that our employees conduct business in an ethical and transparent manner. All of our policies are accessible to employees via the company intranet site. These include:
1. Our Modern Slavery policy which sets out the organisation’s stance on modern slavery and explains how our employees can identify instances of this and how they must report it.
2. Our Code of Ethics/Anti-Bribery policy which contains guidance on how to apply our values and ethical standards in day to day business and how to report any concerns. Our employees are expected to engage in and promote honest and ethical conduct and report any possible violation of these standards. All employees are required to undertake training to ensure that they understand the company’s ethical standards. Violation of our code of ethics is a disciplinary offence.
3. Our Whistleblowing policy which encourages our employees to raise concerns regarding practices within our business and supply chain without fear of reprisal. Training on our Whistleblowing policy is distributed annually.
We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners, therefore we have amended our standard supplier contractual terms to include obligations on suppliers to comply with our Supply Chain Code of Conduct. Failure to comply with our Code would constitute a material breach of the supplier contract.
Our due diligence and audit processes
Every new supplier we employ to conduct business on our behalf is required to follow our stringent due diligence checks prior to completing contracts. Our due diligence checks in relation to the prevention of Modern Slavery include a vendor conformity checklist which requires the company to declare any non-conformity to our high standards, including in relation to human rights.
We have introduced a Supply Chain Code of Conduct, which imposes a duty on our suppliers to act at all times with the highest standards of integrity, ethical conduct and social and environmental responsibility. It reiterates that we will not tolerate or condone any abuse of human rights within any part of our business or supply chain. All of our suppliers are required to sign a declaration stating they commit to comply with all requirements incorporated into the code before acting on our behalf.
We have also introduced a Supply Chain Compliance Risk Framework which allows us to monitor our key risks, including the risk of Modern Slavery occurring in our supply chain. As part of the risk framework our dedicated Supply Chain Compliance Officer conducts audits and implements mitigating controls where required.

Assessment of Modern Slavery risk within our supply chain
As our business continues to grow, we recognise our company’s exposure to risk increases the more expansive our supply chain becomes. Therefore, we have increased our Compliance oversight capabilities within our wider business operations. This began with the appointment of a dedicated resource for Supply Chain Compliance in 2016. This role has responsibility for the ongoing oversight of our supply chain risks, including Modern Slavery. Since the appointment, we have conducted a risk assessment of our third party logistics and repairers, assessing them on specific supply chain compliance risk categories.
Following the completion of the risk assessment, we are working with our third party suppliers to encourage the adoption of our best practices, as well as to identify where their controls can be strengthened so that we can all protect the people who work in our supply chain from any form of human rights abuse.
Modern Slavery Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of Modern Slavery in our supply chains and our business, we have developed and delivered training on Modern Slavery to all relevant employees.
The training provides information on the different forms of Modern Slavery, some common indicators to look out for and the actions an employee must take if they suspect that it is occurring within our business or supply chain. This training will form part of the on boarding process for roles which have the closest contact with our supply chain and refresher training will be delivered to relevant employees annually.
We have cited our existing whistleblowing procedure as one route for employees to report instances of Modern Slavery. Whistleblowing awareness training is delivered annually to all employees. Similarly, Code of Ethics training is expected to be completed annually by all employees.
Further steps to prevent Modern Slavery in our Supply Chain
Although we have made significant progress last year in raising awareness of Modern Slavery and implementing preventative controls, we need to remain vigilant. We will:
1. Continue to integrate The Warranty Group with Assurant and align our modern slavery efforts across both organisations to ensure we have consistency in our processes and tools.
2. Continue to conduct risk based on-site audits on suppliers to assess their culture and controls relating to labour and human rights and provide recommendations for improvements.
3. Review the previous year’s initiatives intended to mitigate the risk of Modern Slavery for effectiveness and consider potential improvements for the coming year.

Measuring how we’re doing
We will check how we are measuring against our business standards in a number of ways: 1. We will measure the number of audits completed and the outcomes and actions implemented. 2. We will regularly review and monitor completion of our Modern Slavery training. 3. We will test a segment of our employee population and obtain feedback to measure awareness and the success of our messaging campaign. 4. We will track instances of Modern Slavery practices identified in our business or supply chain by employees, members of the public or law enforcement agencies and the remedial actions taken in response.
This statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 25th March 2019.

This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ""Act""). It sets out the steps that Alfred Dunhill Limited has taken during the financial year ending 31 March 2018 to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its supply chains or within any part of the business.
Alfred Dunhill Limited has a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings. We recognise that no supply chain is without risk of modern slavery and it is our responsibility to ensure we understand these risks and work together with our suppliers to mitigate them.
OUR BUSINESS
Alfred Dunhill Limited engages with carefully selected suppliers to manufacture its products and/or provide relevant services to the company. We sell our branded products either through Alfred Dunhill Limited's own-managed points of sales or through authorised wholesale accounts.
As part of the Richemont Group (""Group""), Alfred Dunhill Limited adheres to Group policies, procedures and standards relating to the management of its supply chain and its general business conduct. Details of the Group's business governance and corporate social responsibility policies can be found at https://www.richemont.com/corporate-socialresponsibility/governanceethics/policies.html
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN RELATIONSHIPS
Alfred Dunhill Limited strives to maintain good relationships with suppliers based on the principles of fair, open, honest and ethical dealings at all times whilst ensuring the continued quality of its branded products.
Alfred Dunhill Limited has an extensive range of global supplier relationships. However, from 1 September 2017, all inventory purchasing and distribution flows were transferred from Alfred Dunhill Limited to a Richemont Group Company based in Switzerland to improve operational efficiencies within the brand. We now indirectly source finished products, through this Richemont Group Company.
OUR POLICIES AND PROCESSES
When taking on new product suppliers, Alfred Dunhill Limited undertakes due diligence that is carried out by the supply chain and procurement teams within the business. As part of this process, suppliers are required to sign our terms and conditions of purchase and other documents including the Richemont Group Supplier Code of Conduct (""Code of Conduct"").

The Code of Conduct covers the following areas:
- No forced employment — not using forced labour and not using employment where terms are not voluntary; - Healthy and safe working conditions — providing a healthy and safe working environment in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; - Wages and working hours — complying with local legislation on minimum wages, working hours and employee benefits; - Freedom of association — allowing workers to associate with lawful and peaceful workers' associations; - No discrimination — net subjecting people to discrimination based on factors including ethnicity, age, religion and sexual orientation, amongst others; - No child labour — net employing people under the age of 15 or younger than the age for completing compulsory education; - No use of corporal punishment — and not subjecting people to harassment, violence or intimidation; - Responsible environmental management — fully complying with local legislation, industry regulations and the Richemont Environmental Code of Conduct; - Grievance Procedure and Whistleblowing — allowing workers to report actual or suspected misconduct without fear of reprisal.
A full copy of the Code of Conduct, which was updated in 2017, is available at: https://www.richemont.com/images/csr/2017/supplier_code_of_conduct_2017.pdf
Alfred Dunhill Limited also works in partnership with an accredited compliancy verification company in order to carry out audits of our suppliers. Our suppliers are audited at least every 3 years. The audits cover manufacturing sites including sub-contractors. We audit suppliers according to the SEDEX Member Ethical Trade audit formats which assess the suppliers on Health & Safety, Labour Standards, Environment and Business Ethics in line with our Supplier Code of Conduct.
In the event that Alfred Dunhill Limited's due diligence processes, including audits, highlight a risk of slavery and/or human trafficking, or any other noncompliance with the Code of Conduct, we will assess such non-compliance on a case by case basis and take appropriate remedial action.
We endeavour to trade only with those suppliers who comply with the Code of Conduct or those who are taking verifiable steps towards compliance. Arrangements with suppliers in material or persistent breach will be terminated.
We also recognise the risk that modern slavery can exist within our non-product supply chain.
During the financial year ending 31 March 2018, Alfred Dunhill continues to source directly from non-product suppliers. We request these suppliers to adhere to our Group's Code of Conduct and we continue to assess those suppliers who have not returned a signed confirmation of compliance, in order to ensure they have sufficient processes and policies in place to satisfy us that they are operating to the highest standards.

employee awareness and engagement regarding slavery and human trafficking issues. Richemont's Corporate Social Responsibility Guidelines (""Guidelines""), which defines the standards the Group expects its managers, employees and suppliers to uphold, specifically articulate the Group's zero-tolerance policy regarding forced labour.
A copy of the Guidelines can be found at: https://www.richemont.com/images/csr/2012/extract_corporate_social_responsbilitiy_gu

The module helps to recognize and raise the awareness on human trafficking while also explaining how to avoid the risks in our supply chains through different case scenarios.

119,"PCI Pharma Services Ethical Statement
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps the Company is taking to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our business.
Company Overview
PCI is an integrated full service provider and a trusted partner to leading companies in the global healthcare industry; we offer unparalleled expertise and experience in taking compounds from the earliest stages of development through to commercial launch, delivering speed to market and commercial success for our customers.
Core services include: analytical services, formulation development, clinical trial supply, commercial manufacturing and packaging, QP services, supply chain management, storage and distribution.
PCI’s Philosophies and Principles
PCI’s Corporate Code of Ethics and Business Conduct provides a set of rules based on both national and international standards to ensure PCI’s employees are upholding the highest level of ethical conduct in their day-to-day business.
PCI strives to ensure that it does not contribute towards adverse human rights impacts through its supply chains. There is an on-going commitment to engage only those suppliers that uphold the same principles as PCI and where necessary ensure the implementation of corrective action measures. In the event that suppliers fail to take steps to cease or prevent adverse human rights impacts, PCI will reconsider its business relationships with those suppliers.
Supply Chain Overview
The Pharmaceutical Supply Chain is highly regulated with several layers of suppliers from source of raw materials to the distribution of final product. Although recognising human rights and environmental impact in the supply chain is ultimately our suppliers’ responsibility, as customers, PCI work closely with them to clearly communicate our expectations. This encourages a relationships based on trust and transparency.
In our standard procurement process we only use approved suppliers who are regularly audited by Quality and Compliance teams. If any issues are identified during an audit the supplier is required to prepare a Corrective Action Plan and resolve all issues within an agreed time period.
When purchase orders are issued, they incorporate our Standard Terms & Conditions of purchase (T&C’s). The Regional Purchasing Policy (POL-012) has been issued internally to ensure all staff are aware of obligations when dealing with suppliers.

All goods are inspected at point of receipt. Compliance to specification is confirmed which includes full traceability of all materials, country of origin and transparency during the manufacturing process. This is ensured through stringent documentation controls.
Review of Internal Policies
A review of PCI’s existing Corporate Code of Ethics and Business Conduct was conducted in 2016 to ensure its relevance and compliance with the Act. A copy of the Corporate Code of Conduct can be found here.
PCI’s Continued Commitment
PCI recognises the importance of maintaining constant vigilance to identify and address any impacts associated with slavery and human trafficking throughout its supply chains. In recognition of the salience of these issues, PCI is committed to continuing to enhance its capacity to identify, prevent and mitigate any actual or potential impacts in this field.

O R G A N I Z AT I O N A L STRUCTURE AND SU PPLY CHAIN S
Established in 1998, lululemon athletica inc. is the parent company of lululemon Athletica UK Ltd and lululemon Athletica Ireland Limited.
lululemon athletica inc. is a designer, distributor and retailer of healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel in the clothing industry. We have developed a distinctive corporate culture, and we have a mission to produce products which create transformational experiences for people to live happy, healthy, fun lives. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories for women, men and female youth under the lululemon and ivivva brands.
We internally review our supply chain to evaluate modern slavery risks, and we conduct ongoing in-depth supplier assessments for new and existing vendors. These cover all aspects of the supply chain including health and safety, human trafficking, forced labour, child labour and other legal requirements and industry expectations.

INTRODUCTION FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
W e are committed to continually improving our practices to ensure there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain. lululemon athletica inc. takes its obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010 very seriously and has a robust working practice to comply with its obligations. This policy document sets out those practices and gives insight into the supply chain and business processes of the company.

RELEVANT POLICIES In keeping with our commitment to act with integrity in all our business dealings, many of our existing policies are relevant to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in any part of our business or our supply chains. Our relevant policies include:
• Global Code of Conduct and Business Ethics
• Vendor Code of Ethics • Foreign Migrant Worker Standard
In our Global Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, the relevant sections cover ‘Non-Discrimination and Non-Harassment’, ‘labour practices’ and ‘respect for our Guests and Others’.

We provide guidance and training to support employee understanding of expected behaviour, particularly in respect of their business decisions and conduct. We encourage employees to raise concerns and we detail this in our [Global Code of Conduct and Business Ethics policy].
Our VENDOR CODE OF ETHICS (VCoE) is the cornerstone of our approach to a responsible supply chain, outlining our legal, humane and ethical standards of production. Any form of forced labour, including but not limited to indentured and bonded labour and involuntary overtime and prison is a zero tolerance VCoE violation. It applies to all vendors, their employees and supply chains.
Our Foreign Migrant Worker Standard stipulates that all work must be completed on a voluntary and legal basis. It sets forth additional minimum requirements and provides clarity to vendors and their third party labour brokers for ethical recruitment and management of foreign migrant

workers; a group vulnerable to forced labour practices. It applies to all facilities with foreign migrant workers.
RISK ASSESSMENT AND DUE DILIGENCE The risk of slavery and human trafficking within our own organisation is substantially avoided and mitigated as a result of strict policies and procedures as well as the oversight built into our business operations and the knowledge and skills of our staff. We assess risk based on a number of factors including geographical risk indices pertaining to human rights, the level of supply chain control, external governance factors and levels of political stability.
We consider that the greatest risk of slavery and human trafficking is in our supply chain as we do not manufacture our own apparel.
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we undertake due diligence and reviews which include:

• Identifying region-specific risks: Ongoing country environmental, social, political risk tracking help us identify specific regional risks and vulnerable groups.
• Vendor selection: Careful screening and selection of values-aligned vendor partners helps us mitigate risk and facilitates opportunities to better understand issues, address risks, and leverage opportunities.
• Vendor Code of Ethics assessments: Regular VCoE assessments help us identify and evaluate risks as well as to address issues identified. [See Vendor Code of Ethics assessments section above.]
• Industry collaboration: We work with industry organizations, stakeholder groups, and other brands to evaluate and address human rights and labour risks including modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labour.
For example, these processes helped us identify foreign migrant workers as a group particularly vulnerable to forced labour practices. In 2015,

we engaged to understand individual and systemic issues faced by these workers starting with Taiwan, where a majority of our fabric is made. Through collaboration with key stakeholders, we developed our Foreign Migrant Worker Standard, which has been incorporated into our Vendor Code of Ethics Manual.
CERTIFICATION , ONGOING VERIFICATION AND EVALUATION Our VCoE applies to all vendor partners that make products. Before beginning a relationship with us, vendors must agree to our VCoE requirements as a condition of their legal contract with lululemon athletica inc. and sign a Certificate of Compliance. Our VCoE requires vendors to implement the VCoE and all applicable laws into their procedures. This means vendors must abide by the laws of the country in which they are doing business. In cases where there is a difference between requirements of local law, international law and our VCoE, the more stringent standard applies.
To ensure that our vendors uphold our VCoE requirements, our in-house experts and commissioned third-party assessors conduct announced, semi-announced, or unannounced assessments, as well as subsequent follow-up and verification visits. We assess all strategic finished goods and raw materials vendor partner facilities annually, covering approximately 80% of our production. The remaining facilities are assessed at least every eighteen months. We assess subcontractors selectively based on risk factors (e.g. the presence of foreign migrant workers). We will broaden our assessments to include trim suppliers over the next three years.

• Compliance monitoring: we maintain VCoE assessment facility ratings, tracking all related assessment findings and resolutions
• Target setting: we set goals for specific performance areas under our VCoE and our Foreign Migrant Worker Standard, such as document access or recruitment fees
• Assessing feedback: we listen to feedback from our stakeholders and supply chain partners and continually evaluate and improve our approach to addressing supply chain issues.
TRAINING AND AWARENESS We ensure that we have competency within our organization attained through training relating to human rights and the awareness, including standards such as the social accountability standard SA8000.
We work to protect the integrity of our supply chain by regularly engaging and educating our vendors, assessors and internal teams on supply chain issues, including those related to modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labour. We do this by:
• conducting annual formal trainings on our VCoE program for our senior leaders in sourcing, quality, and procurement departments, as well

as decision makers at our liaison offices; • holding annual VCoE training and engagement
sessions for relevant finished-goods and raw materials vendor partners; and • engaging vendors and select stakeholders on region-specific or key issues, such as providing education and training for Taiwanese vendors regarding foreign migrant worker realities and our policies.
In addition, we regularly engage with industry organizations (e.g. American Apparel and Footwear Association, Sustainable Apparel Coalition), expert consultants (e.g. Verité ), and other brands to stay abreast of the latest developments, issues and regulations and collaborate where possible.
For additional information on our policies and practices toward eradicating modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labour in our supply chain, see lululemon athletica inc’s KNOW THE CHAIN BENCHMARK disclosure by Humanity United, Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, Sustainalytics and Verité .
We welcome your feedback on our disclosure and our efforts to prevent modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labour. Please email us at SUSTAINABLEPARTNER@LULULEMON.COM.

Policies in relation to modern slavery We recognise that having the right policies in place and ensuring they are implemented effectively is fundamental to managing the risk of modern slavery in our business and supply chains. Britvic has developed a suite of policies that relate to ensuring ethical business practices are followed and these are supported by further procedures and guidance. Our approach is guided by international conventions and standards, including the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code. Britvic has established a Modern Slavery Working Group, made up of representatives from across the relevant business functions, to oversee our approach to preventing modern slavery and review the effectiveness of our policies and processes.
Our Policies 1. Code of Conduct This sets out Britvic’s core values and how we work. It explains what “doing the right thing” means for Britvic, including with respect to human rights and speaking up about concerns. The code applies to all Britvic employees across all our markets.
2. Ethical Business Policy This policy sets out the appropriate ethical and legal behaviour an individual is expected to adopt when doing business on behalf of Britvic. It states that we “respect and protect human rights by ensuring that we and our suppliers work in a clean and safe environment, have proper standards of employment, comply with local laws and don’t oppress or exploit anyone”. This policy applies to all Britvic employees across all our markets. It also applies to all third parties acting on behalf of Britvic including secondees, advisors, agency workers, contractors and other companies.

3. Ethical Business Standards These standards, linked to our Ethical Business Policy, set out the ethical business requirements expected of both Britvic operations and our suppliers. It states that “standards of employment must comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 which forbids the employment of anyone under conditions of: ‘forced labour’, ‘compulsory labour’, ‘slavery’ or ‘servitude’ or the exploitation of any person by ‘human trafficking’.” Furthermore, Britvic and our suppliers must maintain standards of employment in accordance with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code, as summarised below:
1. Employment is freely chosen 2. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are respected 3. Working conditions are safe and hygienic 4. Child labour shall not be used 5. Living wages are paid 6. Working hours are not excessive 7. No discrimination is practiced 8. Regular employment is provided 9. No harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed
The above policies are available at www.britvic.com/sustainable-business/resources.
Implementation Our policies have been embedded in our GB, Ireland and France business units for a number of years. Employees are required to complete training on its code of conduct and ethical business policy on joining. It is a key business objective to drive compliance to our Ethical Business Policy across all our employees and supply chain.
Modern slavery due diligence Our suppliers As part of our responsible sourcing programme and to help us monitor and assess the ethical risks and performance of our supply chain, all suppliers of direct materials (ingredients and packaging) in our GB, Ireland and France business units are required to join Sedex, complete the Sedex self-assessment ethical questionnaire and give us access to their data through the on-line database. We assess each supplier’s risk using the platform risk assessment tool which identifies the likelihood of an issue occurring. The risk score is calculated using inherent risk based on country, product area, sector profile and site function. The programme will be rolled out to our Brazil business unit in 2018.
WHAT IS SEDEX
Sedex is a not-for-profit organisation and the largest collaborative platform for sharing ethical supply chain data. It is dedicated to driving improvements in ethical and responsible business practices in global supply chains and has more than 47,000 members in over 150 countries (as reported on www.sedexglobal.com on 5 March 2018). It has a secure, online database which allows members to store, share and report information about labour standards, health & safety, the environment and business ethics.
Britvic requires all direct suppliers identified as “high-risk” to have a SMETA audit (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit), which assesses and verifies compliance against: Labour Standards (including absence of forced labour), Environmental Standards, Business Ethics (including absence of Bribery & Corruption) and Health & Safety. These audits also include confidential interviews with a percentage of the workforce and are carried out by independent auditors from internationally recognised audit bodies. If any issues or non-compliance with the audit standard are identified during an audit, the supplier is required to prepare a corrective action plan and remediate them within an agreed time period.

Our own business As part of our commitment to meet the same standards that we’re asking of our supply chain, all of our manufacturing sites in GB, Ireland, France and Brazil have completed the Sedex self-assessment questionnaire. During FY17, SMETA 4 pillar audits were completed at three out of four of our GB manufacturing sites and at both of our manufacturing sites in Ireland. Our two Ebba manufacturing sites in Brazil had audits in FY16. Our newly acquired manufacturing site in Brazil, our remaining GB site and all four of our French sites will have SMETA audits in 2018.
Working in partnership Britvic is committed to continual improvement of our ethical processes, including how they relate to modern slavery. In the financial year ending 1 October 2017, we continued to engage with external partners to meet this objective:

(i) Sedex We continue to proactively contribute to the Sedex data platform and its continuous improvement. This year, we contributed to Sedex’s 2017 review of the SMETA audit standards. The review focussed on updating the audit standard in line with best practice and emerging issues, including increasing its robustness in assuring the absence of modern slavery at audited manufacturing sites.

(ii) AIM-PROGRESS Britvic continued our membership of the AIM-PROGRESS initiative in 2017. This is a global FMCG manufacturer and supplier forum whose goal is to positively impact people’s lives through combined leadership of robust responsible sourcing practices throughout our supply chains. AIMPROGRESS members exchange views and share learnings that help us to develop best practice and continually enhance our ethical processes. Further information can be found at www.aim-progress.com

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY - CSR
At Grange Hotels, we recognise the importance of proactive engagement and the role we have to play in managing the constantly changing social, economic and environmental issues within our local communities.
Our business approach is grounded in beliefs which seek to integrate and maintain practices that promote positive contribution to local life whilst ﬁnding innovative ways to minimise the environmental impact on the communities in which we operate.
Central to this strategy is the strength of the ongoing relationship that Grange Hotels continues to develop with its employees, guests, partners, and stakeholders. Grange Hotels places responsibility at the core of what we do and focuses that into four key areas.
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS
DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
MODERN SLAVERY ACT Statement on Slavery and Human Trafﬁcking Grange Hotels are committed to improving our procedures to combat slavery and human trafﬁcking both within our own business and that of our supply chains. As part of our due diligence processes we shall make enquiries with all new suppliers as to the mechanisms they have in place to combat slavery and human trafﬁcking and we will require all new suppliers to express their commitment to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Organisation's Structure We are a collection of private luxury hotels located in London. We have circa 2000 employees and primarily operate within the UK. Our Policies We have a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafﬁcking and we are committed to ensuring that it has no presence in our supply chains or in any part of our business. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafﬁcking is not taking place. Our internal policies and employment procedures are reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Particular policies relevant to the combating of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking include our Procurement Policy (which establishes our supplier selection methodology) and Whistleblowing Policy (designed to encourage and protect any member of staff who wishes to raise any concerns related to the activities of the ﬁrm). Due Diligence Processes Our recruitment processes are transparent and reviewed regularly. We communicate directly with candidates to discuss job opportunities and to conﬁrm the details of any offer made and work only with reputable recruitment businesses. We have robust procedures in place for the vetting of new employees and ensure that we are able to conﬁrm their identities and that they are paid directly into an appropriate, personal bank account. We have fairly extensive supplier relationships. Each outsourced service supplier is carefully considered as are other suppliers when awarding or renewing business. We review our suppliers on a regular basis and have committed to work with organisations who share our values. We monitor and review the controls undertaken by our suppliers and now require, from our key suppliers, an annual statement of their commitment to our Supplier Code of Conduct. We are conscious that imported products or services sourced from outside the UK or EU are potentially more at risk of slavery or human trafﬁcking issues. If products have to be sourced from such locations, we will look to those suppliers who can demonstrate a commitment to human rights and fair working conditions. We will not work with any supplier organisation that has been found to have been knowingly involved in either human trafﬁcking

or modern slavery. Training To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to relevant staff as part of their induction and provide refresher training as appropriate. Our Supply Chains We have long standing relationships with our supply chains the majority of whom also operate within the UK but we do contract with suppliers from or whom operate in other jurisdictions. Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafﬁcking We shall undertake annual review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure that here is no slavery or human trafﬁcking in our supply chains with a view to identifying further steps that we can take. This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the slavery and human trafﬁcking statement of Grange Hotels. The statement has been approved by the Directors who will review and update it as necessary on an annual basis.

The Gore Story

Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement

Share:

W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. and its subsidiaries fully supports efforts to eliminate forced labor and human trafficking. Everyone in our enterprise is expected to demonstrate integrity in all relationships when dealing with suppliers, customers and stakeholders, as well as with other Gore Associates. We are collectively committed to fostering a safe and healthy work environment where all Associates can develop their talents, enjoy their work, and responsibly direct their activities.
Gore’s purchasing terms require that suppliers comply with applicable laws and regulations. Consequently, many of our external suppliers have not been explicitly required to certify or to undergo audit in order to verify the absence of forced labor or human trafficking. However, Gore has established and adopted Gore Guidelines on Social Responsibility (GSR) . These guidelines set forth our expectations regarding fair labor requirements, positive working environments, compliance with legal and environmental regulations, and other topics. Gore expects its suppliers, business partners, distributors, and any other representatives to maintain this same level of social responsibility.
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) “List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor,” has noted that garments and textiles have been determined to be sectors at risk. Most finished apparel products made with Gore fabrics are placed on the market by our customers, many of which have programs in place to address forced labor and human trafficking. Gore is a founding member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition which developed the HIGG Index, to drive transparency of fair labor conditions within the value chain. Gore is an active user of the HIGG Index for assessing and sharing sustainability performance of our manufacturing units. We encourage our suppliers to use the Higg Index Social / Labor Module to assess their performance on fair working conditions.
Our GORE® WEAR business has affiliated with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), adopting that organization’s Code of Conduct for garment manufacture. This requires that GORE® WEAR garment manufacturing facilities conduct business in alignment with the FLA Code of Conduct or an equivalent code of conduct and to perform third party audits to verify the garment manufacturers’ compliance. Additionally, social audit spot checks are performed by the Fair Labor Association.
Associates involved in supply chain management of finished apparel products have received training which includes the subjects of human trafficking and forced labor. A confidential reporting channel, specific to social responsibility matters, has been designated to handle reports of non-compliance.
Outside of our Fabrics division, in 2017 we began educating Associates in our Performance Solutions Division on human trafficking risks. Associates with exposure to market sectors with known human trafficking risks are required to study our Human Trafficking Briefing.
We continue to review our Enterprise for potential risks of modern slavery and human trafficking, and commit to mitigating those risks wherever we find them.

RISK ANALYSIS AND DUE DILIGENCE

Volunteering: Frequent visits to orphanages, attending volunteer events says a lot about our core values. By doing good deeds without expecting anything in return, INGOT Brokers instils in its employees the art of giving from the heart, humility and the sense of giving back to community. INGOT Brokers Provide training to staff in key risk functions to support the identification of labour and human rights issues.

We also provide all new employees with face-to-face and/or online training in relation to the Code of Business Conduct; and We plan to conduct a human rights in the supply chain workshop which will include participation from relevant procurement and risk staff and several key suppliers. As part of our commitment to combating modern slavery, we have implemented the following policies and procedures:
o Code of Business conduct; o Whistle-blower Policy; and o Recruitment and Retention Policy. As a financial services organisation within a highly regulated environment, INGOT Brokers considers the risk of modern slavery within its operations to be low, However we undertake due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers, and regularly review our existing suppliers. The Company’s due diligence and reviews include: • Mapping the supply chain broadly to assess particular service or
geographical risks of modern slavery and human trafficking; • Evaluating the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new
supplier. • Reviewing on a regular basis all aspects of the supply chain based on
the supply chain mapping

As a business we take seriously our responsibility to operate ethically. Respecting human rights is a fundamental part of our business.
Outlined below is our position on slavery and human trafficking.
This is our third Modern Slavery Statement and sets out steps taken by Superdry Plc (which includes its wholly owned subsidiaries C-Retail Limited, DKH Retail Limited and SuperGroup Internet Limited) to ensure modern slavery does not take place in any part of our business and supply chain. We have updated our statement with progress made in the last 12 months; our overall modern slavery strategy remains on track.
We review our approach on a regular basis and seek to continually improve through ongoing risk assessment, raising awareness of issues and requirements, and by delivering training to our colleagues and working in partnership with our suppliers and partners.
About Superdry
We design, produce and sell clothing and accessories globally under the Superdry brand.
At Superdry we focus on high quality, contemporary products with a strong link between our brand values and our product attributes: design detail; quality obsession; end-to-end innovation; and affordability.
Our products are:
•   Designed at our head office based in the UK. •   Manufactured through third party suppliers globally. •   Sold globally through our stores, through e-commerce sites and through our wholesale
customers.
These activities are co-ordinated by a global team of almost 5,000 employees and a network of trusted suppliers and business partners.

About our Supply Chain
Superdry works with apparel, footwear and accessory suppliers, the majority of which are based in India, Turkey and China. Our suppliers may choose to use subcontractors (also known as Tier 2) where specialist components are required or services needed which cannot be completed on these main production sites (Tier 1). Our suppliers’ source branded trims and labels through a network of nominated and sourced suppliers (Tier 3).
In September 2017 we announced our goal to use 100% organic cotton in all apparel by 2040. This goal is ambitious and will have significant impacts on extending visibility through our organic cotton supply chains. To achieve this we plan to establish dedicated organic supply

chains, with fabric, spinning and ginning mill traceability. As a part of this we plan to establish risk assessment and monitoring in key sites to support our modern slavery strategy.
We also have a network of suppliers providing services to support day-to-day business operations, examples of which include transportation, warehousing and store ancillary services.
We operate sourcing offices in key source countries, which function to support our suppliers in manufacturing our apparel, footwear and accessories in line with our standards – from quality standards, through to compliance with our ethical standards including our Modern Slavery Policy.
Our Commitment to Human Rights and our Modern Slavery Policy
As an integral part of our commitment to human rights, we actively seek to ensure that our business, business partners and all parts of the associated supply chain are free from all forms of slavery and human trafficking.
Our Modern Slavery Policy applies to all colleagues, suppliers and business partners and requires them to implement effective due diligence processes to enable us to understand and identify the potential risks of slavery and human trafficking so that we can report actual and suspected cases to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.
Our commitment to human rights is further re-enforced through all of our ethical trading policies, which are contained within our supplier manual, and all contracts from 2016 onwards contain a requirement to comply with it.
Our:-
1.   Ethical trading Code of Practice is based on international standards including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Core Conventions on Labour Standards.
2.   Migrant and Contract Worker Policy and Guidelines aim to protect vulnerable groups of workers by requiring ethical recruitment practices, appropriate conditions for accommodation, and effective communication of terms and conditions of employment.
3.   Subcontractor Policy aims to support ongoing mapping of our supply base, and to ensure our standards are actively communicated and supported within this tier. To date, this policy has been rolled out in factories producing 83% of our volume by number of units delivered.
All policies have been developed in consultation with organisations including the Ethical Trading Initiative, and local experts. Their ongoing development is managed by our ethical trading team, which is overseen by our Executive Committee and Board of Directors.
How we implement The Modern Slavery Policy

If at any point we suspect or identify any cases of modern slavery, we commit to support the remediation of any victims – working with business partners, other brands, governments and NGOs as applicable. We also commit to assist law enforcement agencies with the investigation, identification and prosecution of any party that knowingly engages in or facilitates slavery or human trafficking.
1. Raising Awareness for Colleagues, Suppliers and Business Partners
During this financial year, Superdry trained 90 supplier-facing colleagues and selected suppliers to raise awareness of our Modern Slavery Policy – to support the continued risk assessment and roll-out of our due diligence processes.
This rolling training programme continues to support our cross business risk assessment and rollout plan of our Modern Slavery Policy.
2. Embedding human rights across our business
Superdry has a growing global team focused on human rights and wider sustainability.
This team manages our ethical trading programme as well as progress towards environmental targets.
We have established a number of mechanisms across our organisation to ensure human rights continue to be embedded in day-to-day business practice:
•   We regularly audit all main production sites (Tier 1) and their subcontracted units (Tier 2) on a semi-announced and unannounced basis. We are starting to enrol Tier 3 (trims and labels) into our ethical trading monitoring processes. In the last 12 months we have started to enrol Tier 3 (trims and labels) into our ethical trading pre-approval processes, reaching 100% coverage in Turkey with the aim to extend this to 100% in India in the next financial year.
•   We risk assess human rights impacts within our business and supply chain and adapt our programme to ensure any issues are addressed. In the last 12 months we have established a dedicated migrant worker assessment, which in part targets modern slavery risk identification at factories with international migrant workers.
•   We have established robust ethical pre-approval processes for all main factory sites (Tier 1) and subcontracted units (Tier 2) to ensure we continue to work with the best possible partners. In the last 12 months we have started to enrol Tier 3 (trims and labels) into our ethical trading pre-approval processes, reaching 100% coverage in Turkey with the aim to extend this to 100% in India in the next financial year.
•   We established dedicated local ethical trading experts in key source countries to work closely with our suppliers’ factories and their subcontracted units. In the next financial year we plan to extend the teams reach to satellite countries including Vietnam, Cambodia and Sri Lanka.
•   We provide training and support for factories to remediate any issues where identified. An example of this is that we are trialling ways of strengthening factory grievance

mechanisms by working with locally based NGOs and former trade union representatives in India. Please refer to our Gender Empowerment Case Study for more information on providing 6,181 workers with access to effective grievance mechanisms.

We continue to collaborate alongside other Ethical Trading Initiative members to support the development of best practice guidelines where industry wide risk has been identified.

3. Measuring the Effectiveness of our Ethical Trading Programme

We monitor the ongoing impacts of our ethical trading programme and report to our Executive Committee and Board of Directors regularly to provide continued oversight.
An update on targets set in the last financial year and the targets we are setting ourselves for the next financial year are set out below:-

FY18 Target

FY18 Progress

All supplier facing colleagues trained in head office on a rolling basis.

126,"MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT June 2018
At Grosvenor Group we strive to operate as a responsible business. Integral to this commitment is our full and active support for the aims of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We aim to ensure that slavery, human trafficking and child labour – indeed, any abuse of human rights – have no place in our business or our supply chains. By creating a culture of awareness and transparency within our own organisation and within our business relationships, and by actively engaging and supporting measures to eradicate modern day slavery, we can play our part to help prevent such abuses.
In publishing this annual statement, Grosvenor Group Ltd is pleased to outline the steps that Grosvenor Group* (the “Group”) has taken to meet this objective.
ABOUT GROSVENOR
Grosvenor Group is one of the world's largest privately-owned property businesses. We develop, manage and invest in property in more than 60 cities around the world.
Grosvenor Group’s purpose is to deliver lasting commercial and social benefit. As part of living up to this ambition, for over 10 years we have adopted an approach we call ‘Living cities’ which aims to guide and inspire our property activities.
Achieving strong commercial returns enables our activities to be enduring. Applying our expertise with a farsighted perspective to improve properties and places provides a positive impact on communities, neighbourhoods and cities.
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY CHAINS
Our Group consists of four regional Operating Companies and an Indirect Investment portfolio managed by the holding company.
Direct investment: Grosvenor Britain & Ireland, Grosvenor Americas, Grosvenor Asia Pacific and Grosvenor Europe operate within a devolved model, each being responsible for its own property strategy founded on local experience and assessment of market opportunities. These direct investment activities facilitate the diversification of the Group’s property portfolio by geography, sector, activity, currency and management teams.
Indirect investment: Our Indirect Investment business is tasked with further diversifying Grosvenor’s property-related interests beyond the expertise and strategies of our four regional Operating Companies by investing in third party managed property activities.
As at 31 December 2017, Grosvenor employed 748 real estate and other professionals. For more information about us, our business and our structure, please click here.
Supply chains: Our supply chains relate to our global real estate businesses and encompass personnel, goods and services to support our property business. We source a wide range of goods and services, and our suppliers include manufacturers, construction companies, material suppliers and professional service providers.

ORGANISATIONAL POLICIES
Earning a reputation for quality, integrity, social leadership and responsibility is one of the Group’s three strategic objectives. Conducting our business ethically and with integrity is at the heart of the Grosvenor Group Compact, which acts as a constitution governing the relationship between the Group and its shareholders.
We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. We oppose all forms of slavery and human trafficking, and are committed to taking steps to ensure that these do not occur in our business or our supply chains.
Our modern slavery policy forms part of a series of policies which reflect our commitment to operating in a responsible, sustainable and ethical way. These policies include but are not limited to:
• Employment and labour practices relating, inter alia, to equality, diversity and inclusion • Anti-Money Laundering , Counter Terrorist Financing and Sanctions • Anti-Bribery and Corruption • Tax policy • Prevention of facilitation of tax evasion • Sustainability • Health and Safety • Codes of conduct
ACTIONS TAKEN IN 2017
We have continued to review our business and supply chains to identify and assess the risk of slavery and human trafficking. We have also continued to review the measures already in place to address such risks, and any additional measures that may be warranted in light of these reviews.
While cognisant that we could be at risk of slavery or human trafficking within our own business, we believe that there is a greater risk of slavery or human trafficking occurring within our supply chains (including suppliers of personnel, goods and services) particularly where we are involved, directly or indirectly, in the development, construction and ownership of property.
We acknowledge that slavery and human trafficking may exist in many jurisdictions in which we operate, and/or from which we directly or indirectly procure goods or services, and accordingly we are developing and implementing measures to identify and address any relevant issues that may arise, and implementing appropriate due diligence procedures.
In 2017, we have in the UK: • utilised our newly updated UK supplier questionnaire which includes questions to help us understand a
new potential supplier’s commitment to ensuring that no modern slavery is taking place in its business and own supply chains;
• implemented a process aimed at ensuring that appropriate contractual provisions are incorporated into new supplier contracts, leases, joint venture agreements and other commercial agreements and renewals of such existing contracts. Depending on, amongst other things, the counterparty, jurisdiction and nature of the contract, such appropriate contractual provisions may include undertakings from the counterparty for itself and in respect of certain parties associated with it (i) not to use or employ any form of modern slavery; (ii) take steps to ensure any form of modern slavery is not used or employed in its business or

supply chain (including, where applicable, in connection with any leased premises); and (iii) to comply with appropriate reporting and audit requirements to allow confirmation of the foregoing; and
• worked with training professionals to provide a training programme for current and new staff (as part of our induction programme) on a range of topics, including issues relating to modern slavery and human trafficking and compliance matters.
In addition, our Operating Companies outside the UK have all adopted the Group’s Modern Slavery Act policy.
PLANS TO STRENGTHEN OUR APPROACH IN THE FUTURE
In 2018 and beyond, we intend to strengthen our approach to dealing with modern slavery further. This will involve:
• Creating a new role of Group Data Protection and Compliance Officer whose focus will include the ongoing monitoring and the provision of advice on evolving market practice and legislative initiatives in relation to modern slavery. In addition, this individual will advise on and implement improvements / updates to policies and processes to ensure best practice.
• Rolling out the training package referenced above.
• Our Operating Companies based in North America, Asia and Europe are working towards insertion of contractual provisions relevant to modern slavery and human trafficking issues in applicable new contracts such as joint venture agreements, construction contracts, service agreements and tenancy agreements.
• Our Indirect Investment business incorporating all relevant Grosvenor Group requirements into new deal documentation.

Slavery Statement 2018

AIB Group p.l.c Modern Slavery Statement 2018
This statement has been published in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out the steps taken by AIB Group plc during year ending 31 December 2017 to prevent modern slavery and human trafﬁcking (“Modern Slavery”) in its business and supply chains. This statement is made by AIB Group plc on behalf of AIB Group plc, Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. and all subsidiaries of Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (collectively referred to as the “AIB Group”).

Introduction
AIB Group has a zero tolerance approach to Modern Slavery within its own operations and within the supply chain. We recognise the need to be aware of the risks in our business and our supply chain and have taken appropriate steps to mitigate these risks. Our Code of Conduct underpins all our actions and staff are encouraged to report any concerns which Senior Management are expected to act upon.
Our Business and Supply Chains
AIB Group operates mainly in Ireland but, through its subsidiaries, also has branches and undertakes activities in the UK. Members of the wider AIB Group operate in Northern Ireland as First Trust Bank and in Great Britain as AIB (GB). A list of the AIB Group companies, which do business in the UK, is set out in Schedule 1. As a Financial Services Business, the inherent risk of Modern Slavery in our internal operations is considered relatively low. Our supply chains are primarily conﬁned to the Ireland and the UK, with a small number of our suppliers operating globally.

Policies
AIB Group internal policies include a Code of Conduct which sets out the key standards for behaviour and conduct that apply to all employees. The Code includes particular requirements regarding responsibilities of management for ensuring that business and support activities are carried out to the highest standards of behaviour. The application of the Code is underpinned by policies, practices and training which seek to ensure that it is understood and that all employees act in accordance with it.

We also operate a Speak Up policy which encourages staff to raise any concerns of wrong-doing through a number of channels, both internal and external, including a conﬁdential external help-line. Employees are assured that if they raise a concern in good faith AIB Group will not tolerate victimisation or unfair treatment of the employee as a result.

Our Diversity and Inclusion policy helps us to be the best that we can in our thinking, our decisions, and our

outcomes. By respecting, developing, and harnessing the talents of all our employees, we commit to creating an

inclusive and supportive organisation that treats everyone with dignity and respect. We aim to respond quickly and

Our Outsourcing policy sets out the actions required for the implementation and subsequent monitoring of any new Outsourcing arrangement including the renewal or the alteration to any existing Outsourcing arrangement. The policy includes the requirement for a comprehensive due diligence process prior to the execution of the contract.
Due Diligence of Suppliers and Supply Chain
The largest potential exposure for Modern Slavery risk for AIB Group lies within our supply chains. As stated above, our Outsourcing policy requires a comprehensive due diligence process prior to the execution of the contract. We have speciﬁcally addressed the issue of Modern Slavery within our terms and conditions of contract, to ensure that our suppliers are in compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. This includes the requirement that suppliers conduct regular Modern Slavery risk assessments within their own operations and supply chains, implement appropriate controls to prevent Modern Slavery and notify AIB Group immediately if they become aware of any instances of Modern Slavery within their own operations and/or supply chains.
Assessment of Modern Slavery risk within our Supply Chain
Since 2016, we have increased our attention on the risk of Modern Slavery within our supply chain. In 2016, we completed a risk assessment of our current suppliers focusing on geographical risk, industry/sectoral risk and the use of temporary workers. A written communication was issued to all suppliers considered by the Bank to be high/medium risk, outlining our zero tolerance approach and seeking conﬁrmation of their compliance with applicable regulations regarding Modern Slavery (including the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015).
Modern Slavery Awareness
An awareness-raising session has been launched across AIB Group to inform staff of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, indicators of Modern Slavery, the actions we are taking and the consequences of getting it wrong. We have also encouraged staff to raise concerns through our “Speak Up” policy and provided external contact points.
Assessment of eﬀectiveness in preventing Modern Slavery
Our approach to Modern Slavery risk will evolve and we will continue to mitigate this risk into the future.

128,"Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for Financial Year Ending December 31, 2016
INTRODUCTION
Sealed Air Corporation’s vision is to create a better way for life. It is a vision rooted in sustainability and ethical business practices. It inspires us to continuously strive to develop purposeful innovations that not only fulfil our customers’ needs but also protect products being shipped, improve the security and safety of the food we eat, and improve health by keeping hospitals, hotels, office buildings and other shared environments safe and clean.
The very nature of our business requires a global culture of responsibility and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity and transparency in all business dealings; and to putting effective systems and controls in place to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the business or our supply chain. This statement sets forth our commitment to combat unethical practices in supply chains, as well as comply with requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (“the Acts”).
OUR BUSINESS, STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY CHAIN
We are a global leader in food safety and security, facility hygiene and product protection. We serve an array of markets including food and beverage processing, food service, retail, healthcare and industrial, and commercial and consumer applications through our portfolio of widely recognized brands, including Cryovac® brand food packaging solutions, Bubble Wrap® brand cushioning and Diversey® cleaning and hygiene solution.

OUR POLICIES
We have put in place a number of internal policies to ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner. These include:
1. Global Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy. This policy sets forth our stance on modern slavery and how employees can identify any instances of these practices and where they can report potential non-compliance.
2. Code of Conduct. This provides the foundational standards of conduct for all aspects of our business, and is applicable to all our employees and operations globally. It includes provisions related to, among other things, ethical standards, compliance with laws, safe working conditions, and whistleblowing so which encourages employees to raise concerns about issues they are observing or experiencing in the workplace or within our business functions without fear of reprisal.
3. Supplier Code of Conduct. This code explains our commitment to ethical workplace practices and sets forth the ethical and legal standards we expect suppliers will adhere to. Suppliers are required to demonstrate that they provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and act in accordance with all laws and international and organizational standards governing slavery or forced labor (e.g., International Labour Organization). Additionally, supplier violations of this code may lead to the termination of the business relationship.
DUE DILIGENCE & VERIFICATION OF SUPPLY CHAIN RISK
We expect all suppliers within our supply chain to comply with our values and standards set out in our company Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct. As part of our evaluation process, we may conduct due diligence when considering engaging new suppliers, and regularly review our existing suppliers by:
 Performing internal supplier audits or assessments through our own staff or a thirdparty, which may have a greater degree of focus on slavery and human trafficking where these types of risks are identified; and
 Demanding corrective measures In the event the company becomes aware of any actions or conditions not in compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. We also may terminate an agreement with any supplier who does not comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct or the contractual provisions governing compliance with laws and the provisions set forth in our Code of Conduct.
TRAINING
Our company has a robust global compliance training program in place comprised of mandatory training for employees related to code of conduct and ethical business practices

 Our Supplier Code of Conduct was issued to suppliers in 2016.  We may verify our suppliers’ compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct by
conducting unannounced supplier audits or internal assessments.  We require Suppliers agree to comply with all laws, our Code of Conduct and

Human Trafficing and Slavery Policy Statement
Beeswift Limited acknowledge the provisions of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and will ensure that all its suppliers of goods and services are completely transparent, fully aware of and actively complying with the requirements of the Act. The Company is confident in its Ethical Auditing systems based on the ETI base code and that due diligence with regard to slavery and human trafficking is prioritised. Continual evaluation of our supply chain is intrinsic to our operation and the adoption of all relevant and appropriate measures as and when required to maintain all supply standards including the above is paramount. Imported goods from outside the EU are potentially but not solely at higher risk of slavery and human trafficking issues. Management levels for these supply sources are continually monitored. The Company will not trade with or support any business or organisation it believes are involved in such practices. The Company takes full responsibility for implementing this Policy Statement and its objectives.

This Policy Statement will be subject to an annual review and its findings published accordingly.

131,"Modern Slavery Act Statement 2019
At Travelodge we are committed to supporting human rights and we take seriously our responsibilities under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We have a zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking and are dedicated to understanding the risks so that we can work towards ensuring that there is no modern slavery in our business or supply chains.
Structure of Travelodge Travelodge is one of the UK’s leading hotel brands based on number of hotels and number of rooms operated. The group has approximately 575 hotels primarily across the UK and also in Spain and Ireland; the majority of these hotels are held on a leasehold model and we have a small number of managed and franchised hotels. We operate in the value sector of the hotel market and employ almost 12,000 people across our hotels and support offices.
Thame and London Limited is the holding company of the Travelodge group which includes Travelodge Hotels Limited, the principal UK trading company.
Our supply chains As you would expect in the hospitality sector, our suppliers fall into two broad groups – hotel suppliers and support suppliers. Hotel suppliers cover all goods and services used in the running of a hotel from food and beverages, linen and cleaning supplies to fixtures, fittings, equipment and maintenance services. Our support suppliers provide items such as office supplies, IT support and systems, professional and consultancy services. We also work with employment agencies who supply a limited number of people to work in our support office and hotels.
Procurement for suppliers is managed at a central head office level. We pick our suppliers carefully and where appropriate carry out due diligence on these parties and endeavour to contractually require them to comply with applicable laws.
Our anti-slavery initiatives and policies We have created a modern slavery compliance team, consisting of representatives from our Legal, Procurement and Human Resources departments, to monitor and assess our practices in this area and encourage continued improvement. Our commitment to social

responsibility is reflected in our employee training programmes and company policies and we expect the same high standards from our suppliers.
We encourage our employees to report any ethical concerns and our Whistle-Blowing Policy (which includes a specific section on modern slavery) and use of a third party company to enable and manage whistle-blowing disclosures is intended to make this simple for all colleagues who have concerns. We aim to ensure that appropriate protections are in place for any colleague who raises any concern, without fear of retaliation.
From a HR perspective, we implement ‘right-to-work’ checks on all new employees and undertake regular checks on shift-patterns and the hours worked by our colleagues. We also understand the importance of focusing on having a culture of engaging in all activities with respect and fair treatment of others.
Training We recognise that awareness amongst our employees is important in preventing modern slavery. We aim to complete Child Sexual Exploitation (“CSE”) training twice each year for hotel employees. Our training enables our staff to alert the police to any related issues they identify in the course of their duties. We work with the NSPCC and we also have a strong history of working closely to assist the police in this area.
Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking We have assessed the areas of our business and supply chains where there is a risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place (even if this is small), whether from an activity or geographical perspective. Our central Procurement function assists us to have visibility of our suppliers and a better understanding of the risk areas.
When taking on new suppliers in areas which we consider to be higher risk, we undertake supplier due diligence and engage with potential suppliers to understand the actions taken by them to reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. Comprehensive questions are included in requests for tender where appropriate. We include contractual clauses in all our higher risk supplier agreements and also in our standard template supply agreements in relation to the monitoring and tackling of slavery and human trafficking issues and compliance with legislation.
Key performance indicators We would expect that any incident of modern slavery would be a breach of our company policies, contractual terms and/or law.
We continue to focus on the assessment of our supply chain and high risk areas as well as on ensuring that we do not have any modern slavery in our own business.
Further steps We are proud of the steps which Travelodge has taken so far to combat slavery and human trafficking. However, we recognise that this is an area which requires continual monitoring and improvement and we will continue to do this. Steps which we intend to take on an ongoing basis include:
continuing to focus on new suppliers coming through our Procurement function as well as looking at the renewals of relationships with existing suppliers; carrying out modern slavery awareness training in the induction for new management-level employees; and building on our reduction in the use of temporary worker agencies by carrying out a review of such use to consider whether further improvements can be made.
At Travelodge we firmly believe in being a responsible business and continuing to develop our approach to combating modern slavery forms a key part of this.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 31 December 2018. This statement has been approved by Travelodge’s board of directors, who will review and update it annually.

Modern Slavery Act 2015: Slavery and human trafficking statement
Slavery and human trafficking continues to be a hidden blight on today's global society. We all have a
responsibility to be alert to the risks, however minor, in our business and in our wider supply chain. We
are proud of the steps we are in the process of taking, to combat slavery and human trafficking and
are committed to constantly improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. We will
undertake all reasonable and practical steps including visiting factories and warehouses, to ensure
that our standards are implemented throughout the businesses of our suppliers within PA TOPCO
Limited (TPA). We will only trade with those who fully comply with our standards or those that are
taking verifiable steps towards compliance and, if we find any instances of non-compliance, we will
We have visited and will continue to visit all of our non-European suppliers on an annual basis to
ensure that they comply with all of our current policies. However, this year we have now mapped and
re-assessed the risk areas for our entire supply chain and we have developed and adopted a new
Anti-slavery and human trafficking policy which will be communicated to all employees. We are in the
process of developing a training plan on the new policy to all relevant members of staff and in the next
few weeks we will be contacting our top 50 suppliers to confirm acceptance of this policy.

independent garages and workshops throughout the UK and Ireland. TPA has over 2,700 employees
Our business is organised into a number of branches and units, please [click here] to find out more.
Our supply chains include the worldwide sourcing of automotive parts from major suppliers. As part of
our overall risk assessment, we have identified several countries that we source from (China, India
and Turkey), that have the largest estimated absolute numbers of people in modern slavery. Direct
sourcing from these countries comprises approximately 30% of our global supply chain.
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply
chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting
ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective
systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our

Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
At Estee Lauder, we respect the human rights of our employees, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to upholding the principles contained in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.
By law, companies like ours in the UK are required to disclose publicly the steps we are taking to identify and eradicate forced labour and human trafficking from our supply chains. We are part of a multinational group of companies that operates around the world. The following describes the efforts of our group, including in the UK:

VE R I FICATION

We require our suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws pertaining to forced, trafficked or child labour. Under no circumstances do we allow suppliers to use forced, trafficked, child, prison, indentured or bonded labour, or use corporal punishment or other forms of mental and physical coercion as a form of discipline.

Our work in this area is governed by our Global Supplier Relations team (GSR), which has representatives in each of our regions. GSR, in partnership with Global Quality Assurance, Research & Development, Global Regulatory Affairs, and Global Corporate Responsibility, is responsible for ensuring that the suppliers with whom we do business meet the expectations for ethical behaviour outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct is the foundation we use to set expectations. It is the basis for how we evaluate and help our suppliers meet our high ethical and quality standards in the procurement of our product ingredients and materials. The Supplier Code of Conduct, in conjunction with our standard purchasing contracts, requires that suppliers be in full compliance with all applicable governmental, legal, regulatory, and professional rules and regulations. The Supplier Code of Conduct includes our prohibition on employing forced, trafficked, child, prison, indentured or bonded labour, and using corporal punishment or other forms of mental and physical coercion as a form of discipline.

Forced and child labour are included as risk categories in our supplier risk evaluations and when necessary, we use a third-party firm to assess the potential presence of child labour or forced labour in the supply chain.

STORES

AUDITS
New suppliers must agree to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct before they are awarded our business. Estee Lauder requires its high-risk suppliers to undergo an audit conducted by an independent, third-party auditor at least every two years. Currently, the auditors utilise the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) Best Practice Guidelines and audit report format. If a supplier appears to be in non-compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct, Estee Lauder expects the supplier to co-operate and provide such additional information to Estee Lauder as may be required by Estee Lauder in order for it to make a determination whether the supplier is in compliance. If Estee Lauder determines that the supplier is not in compliance, then the remedies may include, among other things, termination of business with Estee Lauder or the development and implementation of a corrective action plan that would need to be implemented within a certain fixed time period. Estee Lauder may follow such implementation with an audit, as it deems appropriate.
CE RTI FICATION
In addition to requiring our suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, Estee Lauder has used some certification standards providing third-party certification that certain raw materials we purchase are produced without the use of forced labour, including the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).
I NTE R NAL ACCOU NTAB I LITY AN D TRAI N I NG
Regarding our employee base, Estee Lauder is committed to the highest standards of professional and personal conduct. All employees and officers of Estee Lauder are expected to conduct themselves within the letter and spirit of our Employee Code of Conduct. at all times.
All newly hired employees must sign an acknowledgment that they have received the Employee Code of Conduct, understand its contents, and agree to comply with its terms throughout their employment with Estee Lauder. Breaches of the Employee Code of Conduct are treated with the utmost severity and will result in disciplinary action. In addition, on an annual basis, certain management employees are required to re-certify their compliance with and continued commitment to compliance with the Code. For further information about our wider sustainability efforts, please see our latest Sustainability and Citizenship Report
FURTHER ACTION
Since the publication of last year’s anti-slavery and human trafficking statement, we have taken the following further steps to tackle forced labour and human trafficking during the fiscal year ending 30th June 2017:
Included specific provisions in our standard purchasing contracts requiring suppliers to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and commit contractually that neither they nor any other person in their supply chain uses trafficked, bonded, child or forced labour or has attempted to use trafficked, bonded, child or forced labour within their supply chain.
Required prospective suppliers in higher-risk industries to provide information about the steps they are taking to eradicate forced labour and human trafficking from their supply chain when bidding to supply goods and services to Estee Lauder.
Provided additional training on our Supplier Code of Conduct to select Estee Lauder employees responsible for engaging with suppliers.
This statement is made in accordance with section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Estee Lauder's slavery and human trafficking statement for the fiscal year which ended on 30th June 2017. It was approved by the board of directors of Estee Lauder Cosmetics Limited on 5th December 2017.

2 of 3

This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”) and in line with the Home Office statutory guidance. It sets out the steps taken by Zurich UK to ensure that its business and supply chains are slavery free. This statement applies to our practices for the financial year ending 31 December 2018 and continues to apply until any amendments are required. The statement will be subject to an annual review each year.
When we talk about “Zurich UK” in this Statement, we are referring to the companies within the Zurich Insurance Group which are in scope under Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and listed at Appendix 1.
Introduction
We oppose modern slavery and human trafficking in all of its forms, and do not tolerate it within our business or within our supply chain.
Our commitment to respect human rights is part of our Group’s Code of Conduct, which all of our employees are committed to following. We respect the protection of international human rights within our sphere of influence, and work hard to ensure we are not complicit in human rights abuses. Zurich became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact in 2011, which means we are committed to aligning our strategy, culture and day-to-day operations with the Global Compact’s ten universally-accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Six of the ten UN Global Compact principles relate to human rights and Principle 4 specifically commits us to the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour.

136,"HSBC Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017
Date: 20 April 2018

About HSBC
HSBC Holdings plc, the parent company of the HSBC Group, is headquartered in London. HSBC employs approximately 229,000 people to serve around 38 million customers worldwide from approximately 3,900 offices in 67 countries and territories in our geographical regions: Europe, Asia, North America, Latin America, and Middle East and North Africa. With assets of $2,522bn at 31 December 2017, HSBC is one of the world's largest banking and financial services organisations. The Group has four global businesses – Retail Banking and Wealth Management (‘RBWM’); Commercial Banking (‘CMB’); Global Banking and Markets (‘GB&M’); and Global Private Banking (‘GPB’) – supported by 11 global functions. Further detail on the structure and performance of the Group can be found in the Strategic Report section of the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 which was published on 20 February 2018 and is available on the Group website.
Context
This statement is issued by HSBC Holdings plc and covers the policies and procedures that are applied across the HSBC Group, under the provisions of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ‘Act’) and with reference to the guidelines issued by the Home Office: Transparency in Supply Chains - A practical guide, as amended in 2017. We report on the steps HSBC takes to ensure that Modern Slavery does not take place through its lending or project financing. Further, this statement examines some of the ways in which HSBC works with the wider financial community and law enforcement agencies to act against Modern Slavery. This is our second report under the Act. We acknowledge that companies in our own and other sectors still have much to learn. We are committed to improvement, including the further development of management information and other key performance indicators that will allow us to confirm the effectiveness of our policies and procedures. We remain open to and welcome constructive feedback from our stakeholders.
Approach
How we do business is as important as what we do: We want trusting and lasting relationships with our many stakeholders to generate value in society and deliver long-term shareholder returns. Part of that trust stems from our duty of confidentiality to our clients and customers, subject only to regulatory or legal obligations. HSBC follows the International Bill of Human Rights and supports the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including freedom of association. HSBC is a signatory to or has expressed public support for:  The Global Sullivan Principles;  The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises;  The UN Global Compact;  The UN Principles for Responsible Investment; and  The UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance.
Slavery and human trafficking are crimes. The criminals responsible will seek to hide the proceeds in the financial system to legitimise them – effectively, money laundering – and banks have a responsibility to deter, detect and prevent illicit use of the financial system by criminals. HSBC views slavery and human trafficking as egregious examples of human rights abuses, and considers them very seriously in its overall approach to wider human rights issues. In line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights’ Protect, Respect and Remedy framework, HSBC recognises the duty of states to protect human rights and the role played by business in respecting them. In our Statement on Human Rights
April 2018

published in September 2015, we also said that ‘human rights issues are complex and that the roles and responsibilities of business and other stakeholders are the subject of a continuing international dialogue. We are open and willing to engage in this dialogue where appropriate and constructive.’
During 2017, we had meetings or exchanged correspondence with six civil society groups where human rights abuses were alleged, none of which were related to modern slavery or human trafficking; we continued to work within the UK’s Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (‘JMLIT’, see below) on issues including modern slavery and human trafficking; we attended the United Nations’ Business and Human Rights Forum in Geneva; and we joined the UN Global Compact’s UK Modern Slavery Working Group (see below).
The sections below cover how we approach the issues of slavery and human trafficking in this wider human rights context and as part of our commitment to implement the most effective financial crime controls everywhere we operate.
The commitments and policies referenced in this statement apply to all employees in HSBC’s businesses and operations where we have management control and where permitted by national laws and regulations. In countries where national laws and regulations conflict with HSBC’s policies contained in this statement or elsewhere, we will comply with the law but seek, within our spheres of influence, to raise awareness of human rights and act as an example of good practice through our own business conduct.
What we did during 2017
During 2017, HSBC joined the UN Global Compact (UK) Modern Slavery Act Working Group, participating in a series of meetings between companies operating in different sectors to share best practice in reporting under the Act. This included peer review of companies’ MSA statements, highlighting areas for improvement.
In October 2017, then Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver was pleased to be invited to and attend the inaugural meeting of the Business Against Slavery Forum, co-chaired by UK Home Secretary, Rt Hon Amber Rudd MP. HSBC has participated in follow-up meetings covering, inter alia, support for victims, public awareness and mapping the financial footprint of modern slavery.
Employees
HSBC treats all employees with dignity and respect in an environment that is free from discrimination and harassment. HSBC’s commitment to respect human rights in the workplace is manifested in our HSBC Values and human resources policies and practices; all of which promote a safe, diverse and inclusive workplace.
HSBC employees are made aware of their employment rights through a variety of channels including written employment contracts, employee handbooks and staff websites and these are articulated in the HSBC Global Standards Manual and HSBC Values. Employees receive training on a variety of human rights related issues, including but not limited to diversity, money laundering, supplier management and bribery and corruption.
Employees can be confident that their views are encouraged, their concerns are attended to and advancement is based on merit. HSBC operates HSBC Confidential, a global compliance disclosure line (online portal, telephone, post and email), which is available to allow employees to make disclosures when the normal channels for airing grievances or concerns are inappropriate. Concerns are resolved fairly and without retaliation, with conduct that does not conform to HSBC standards treated as a serious violation of our values and policies. Appropriate disciplinary action, which may include termination, is taken against those who engage in inappropriate conduct that is not consistent with our Values . During 2017 no referrals concerning modern slavery were made through HSBC Confidential.
Minimum wage We continue to apply the legal minimum wage in all countries and territories where one exists. Where there is no legal minimum wage, HSBC negotiates with the individual in line with market rates. In 2014, HSBC in the UK was formally accredited by the Living Wage Foundation, having adopted the ‘Living Wage’ and the ‘London Living Wage’.
April 2018

Outsourcing
The most salient risk of encountering modern slavery for HSBC lies where HSBC does not have direct management control. In particular, this may include suppliers who provide support staff in, for example, catering, cleaning or security posts.
Although we had no direct knowledge during 2017 of modern slavery taking place within these outsourced services, we are aware that certain geographies have a heightened risk of such practices. During 2018 HSBC will conduct an enhanced audit of our major suppliers in sectors or geographies where there is material inherent risk, as identified by the International Labour Organisation. We are finalising the suppliers to be audited, with a particular focus on subcontractors.
HSBC has traditionally not audited suppliers on this topic, relying only on self-assessment and disclosure – this will be a pilot to test new processes and any findings will be shared with the wider HSBC Group stakeholders for a potential global roll out, focusing on areas where we perceive the risk to be greatest.
HSBC has had an Ethical and Environmental Code of Conduct for Suppliers since 2005. As articulated in this code, updated with further amendments in 2016 to take account of revised legislation on disability rights, Modern Slavery and human rights, HSBC requires suppliers, including those who then further outsource, to respect the human rights of their employees and the communities in which they operate as well as to comply with all relevant legislation, regulations and directives in the countries and communities in which they operate. Suppliers must prohibit the use of forced labour and child labour and respect labour rights including non-discrimination and the right to freedom of association, and give workers, whether local or migrant, the right and the ability to leave employment when they choose, to the extent possible under local law.
At 31 December 2017, over 4,000 (31 December 2016: 3,400) suppliers had signed up to the Code, or provided their own at least equivalent statement of conduct.
Procurement
In our 2016 statement we said that, wherever possible, we would include in contracts with suppliers an obligation to comply with the Ethical and Environmental Code of Conduct for Suppliers, and that we would update our standard terms of purchase to reflect this. This is an ongoing process; for example, contractual clauses to allow HSBC to seek an undertaking from suppliers that they do not purchase any goods and/or services that have been sourced from suppliers, producers or manufacturers using forced labour in their operations, and that they will notify HSBC of any breach of that undertaking, have been prepared but not yet incorporated as they go through legal review. For significant relationships, we may require an annual slavery and human trafficking report, setting out the steps taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any of the supplier’s supply chains or in any part of its business.
HSBC Procurement in 2017 developed processes to ensure all new suppliers are risk assessed against our Ethical and Environmental Code of Conduct for Suppliers prior to entering into a contractual relationship and, where appropriate, continued compliance is a contractual requirement. Towards the end of 2017, HSBC’s Procurement function introduced a single process / tool to ensure a consistent and consolidated approach is used across the entire HSBC Group.
In all contracts, HSBC includes clauses relating to the right to conduct an audit and the right to terminate a contract. In contract negotiations, we may also use the Vendor’s own terms and conditions where they are at least equivalent to our own. We will be exercising this right on a trial basis, as outlined above, in 2018, specifically looking for any indicators of the use of forced or child labour or any lack of respect for labour rights including non-discrimination and the right to freedom of association, including that workers, whether local or migrant, have the right and the ability to leave employment when they choose.
Last year, we reported that HSBC had worked with the specialist consultancy to risk assess its largest 300 suppliers - responsible for 50 per cent of supplier spend. This assessment has now reached over 530 suppliers. All new suppliers where contracts are valued at US$500,000 or above are routinely assessed. We continued to work with the specialist consultancy to assess in more detail those suppliers identified as presenting the greatest risk, and this remains our focus. No adverse results have been identified to date.
April 2018

We prefer to engage with suppliers who are on a credible path to meeting our standards, including those relating to modern slavery and human trafficking but, where a supplier is unable or unwilling to do so, we will end the relationship as soon as contractually possible, in line with UN and other guidance related to relationships where no reasonable alternative service exists.
During 2017 we continued to review supplier and other third party relationships, assessing risks and concentrating on those markets and economic sectors where it considers the risk to be greatest. A new Third Party Risk Management Framework was introduced during the year, covering modern slavery as well as other financial crime risks.
Financial services providers often share the same suppliers. During 2017 we partnered with three other banks to develop a common platform for risk assessment; this is expected to be operational in 2018 and we will report more fully in next year’s Statement.
Customers and clients
HSBC’s Statement on Human Rights outlines the principal ways in which human rights considerations are addressed in our lending or project financing. HSBC has, since 2002, developed sustainability risk policies incorporating specific standards to be met by business customers operating in those sectors which present the highest social and environmental risks. Social risks refer to unacceptable impacts on people and therefore include abuses of human rights, such as slavery.
The sustainability risk policies apply to the main financing products HSBC provides, such as loans, trade finance and debt and equity capital market services. HSBC’s sustainability risk policies on agricultural commodities, energy, forestry, freshwater infrastructure, mining and metals and project finance all make specific reference to human rights considerations. These include – either directly or via their underlying standards - issues such as forced labour, harmful or exploitative child labour, trafficking, land rights, the rights of indigenous people such as “free prior and informed consent”, workers’ rights and the health and safety of communities. Project finance is subject to the Equator Principles, which utilises the International Finance Corporations’ Performance Standards on issues such as forced labour, child labour and trafficking.
When necessary, we engage with customers to support them in moving towards good practice, which is the most significant contribution we can make to implementing change. However, we close banking relationships with customers where their activities in these sectors are and are likely to remain non-compliant with our risk policies. This can be evidenced in the figures we have released relating to clients in the palm oil sector, where we have ended relationships with a number of companies unable or unwilling to meet our agricultural products policy, which includes provisions in relation to human rights such as: harmful or exploitative child labour or forced labour; the violation of the rights of local communities, such as the principle of free prior and informed consent; and operations where there is significant social conflict.” Our engagement with customers has resulted in an additional 12 palm oil clients introducing and publishing NDPE (no deforestation, no peat and no exploitation) policies.
We investigate credible allegations of human rights violations as they are reported to us via engagement with stakeholders. They are raised directly with the client company by the relationship manager and, if necessary, escalated to senior management both within HSBC and at the client company, up to CEO level. Where required, individual customer relationships are referred to and reviewed by Reputational Risk and Client Selection Committees on a case by case basis. These reviews may decide to restrict or end a customer relationship where it is unwilling or unable to meet HSBC’s standards, including those relating to modern slavery and human trafficking.
Risk management and due diligence
HSBC employs risk officers, based within the global businesses and/or specific regions or countries. Additionally, there is a Sustainability Risk function, responsible for adherence to and implementation of our sector-specific policies.
As reported last year, during 2016 the risk function at HSBC undertook a formal project on the wider human rights risks, including modern slavery, faced by HSBC. This analysis was presented to the Global Risk
April 2018

Management Board, which provides strategic direction for the Global Risk function, sets priorities and oversees the consistent approach to accountability for, and mitigation of, risk. The analysis was used in 2017 to inform the development of a new human rights policy, which is expected to be made public in 2018.
In the ESG Update published on 6 November 2017, HSBC outlined its approach to supporting its customers in the development of sustainable supply chains. The update said:
“Companies face social and environmental challenges within their supply chains, an increased demand for sustainability criteria by consumers to aid their purchasing decisions, and technology aiding transparency and traceability in their supply chains. We aim to support clients by collaborating to develop sustainable solutions. For example, we have taken steps to engage with NGOs and corporate partners to promote sustainability in the palm oil industry… … We have committed funding for the Apparel Impact Institute of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, established to improve the environmental and social impacts of the apparel and footwear industry.”
We will be incorporating human rights issues, including modern slavery and human trafficking, as we address the social challenges in these two sectors, and will report more fully in 2019.
Protecting the financial system
HSBC has a fundamental responsibility to help protect the integrity of the financial system on which we all depend. Modern slavery and human trafficking are crimes and those responsible will seek to launder the proceeds in the financial system to legitimise them. That’s why, as well as seeking to identify modern slavery and human trafficking in our own operations and supply chains, we have significantly stepped up our efforts to keep financial crime out of banking.
Tackling financial crime
HSBC’s industry-leading Financial Crime Threat Mitigation capability, one of eight specialist capabilities within our Financial Crime Risk function, leverages intelligence, investigations, analytics, technology and public-private partnerships to tackle financial crime.
This enables us proactively or reactively to identify existing or emerging risk issues and financial crime quickly and effectively, to ensure that we are focused on how financial criminals seek to exploit our services. In particular, we are analysing the types of activities that are likely to be a focus for, or a sign of, human trafficking and modern slavery, and in doing so we will develop automated monitoring systems proactively to identify them and make frontline employees aware of what to watch for.
Working in partnership
HSBC is a strong proponent of public private partnerships and information sharing initiatives. We play an active or founding member role in partnerships in six countries and, where permissible by law, work cooperatively with other participants in the global financial system to share information in order to tackle financial crime, including that related to modern slavery and human trafficking.
In the UK, HSBC is a leading member of the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (‘JMLIT’). One of JMLIT’s key operational priorities is “understanding and disrupting the funding flows linked to organised immigration crime and human trafficking”. Further information and reporting on JMLIT’s work is available on the UK’s National Crime Agency website. HSBC’s work with JMLIT has led to successes including enabling the UK Police to prosecute a criminal trafficking gang (see below).
HSBC is involved in other collaborative efforts to identify modern slavery and human trafficking related offences, notably taking a lead role with the Thomson Reuters Foundation as part of the European Bankers’ Alliance to produce a practical guide for banks on tackling human trafficking. Designed especially for European financial institutions, the guide was published in July 2017 and includes case studies and examples of suspicious financial patterns that can be warning signs of criminal behaviour. The guide was endorsed by the Wolfsberg Group and is now being progressed in North America and Asia too. Further information is available at: http://www.wolfsbergprinciples.com/
April 2018

Public engagement and awareness-raising
In October 2017, HSBC was invited to the Business Against Slavery Forum – chaired by the UK Home Secretary. The event was attended by the then Group CEO, Stuart Gulliver, who together with seven other business leaders in the UK, committed to joining pioneering industry action to eradicate modern slavery from supply chains.
We work collaboratively with NGOs and think tanks and, in Europe, focus on pan-European committees which are concerned with identifying and policing human trafficking risks. Attendance and delivery of presentations at conferences helps us better understand typologies and different organisations’ approaches. Throughout 2017, HSBC has participated in joint law enforcement and civil society conferences.
We have raised awareness of human trafficking externally by publishing the Fighting financial crime film on hsbc.com and YouTube and promoting it via social media and through allies like the Salvation Army.
HSBC has joined the Thun Group of banks, an informal group with the primary purposes of i) furthering understanding of the UN Guiding Principles and Business and Human Rights within the context of banks, and ii) considering how they may be applied across the range of different banking activities. The Thun Group was pleased to welcome UN Special Representative on Business and Human rights, Prof. John G. Ruggie, the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights, the OECD and civil society representatives to its meeting in June 2017. HSBC was pleased to learn from and contribute to this process.
Support for victims
HSBC is working with the University of Nottingham Slave Free initiative to identify areas where we could more easily facilitate victims’ inclusion in society rather than their continuing to experience the current state, which is usually exclusion from the financial system based on immigration offences.
Training and education
HSBC is committed to raising awareness of the issues of modern slavery and human trafficking with employees. During 2017 we created two videos on the subject, available to all employees:
Fighting financial crime: How criminals are using the banking system to make money from human trafficking victims. This first film included interviews with a victim of trafficking in the UK and with a convicted trafficker from central Europe.
Joining forces to prevent human trafficking: How we worked with the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to tackle a criminal gang. This second film highlighted how HSBC cooperated with law enforcement through JMLIT to assist police in breaking up a human trafficking gang.
The films have been used, in particular, in training sessions with retail branch staff in the UK and worldwide, supported with advice on spotting the signs of human trafficking. They are available on the HSBC website.
In our April 2017 ESG Update, we included a section specifically on human trafficking, including training:
HSBC branch employees are being trained to help law enforcement agencies combat crimes such as human trafficking.
Cashiers are taught to look for warning signs that may indicate a person is being used for sexual or labour exploitation. These include customers not being in possession of original copies of their own identification, with companions – or translators – presenting them on their behalf. Other red flags include shared address, telephone number of employment information, as well as bruises or other signs of physical abuse.
Staff are particularly vigilant where customers come from areas known for human trafficking, with any suspicious behaviour being reported to the relevant local authorities. The bank is also using advanced analytics to scan large amounts of data to help detect illegal activity, according to Jennifer Calvery, Global Head of Financial Crime Threat Mitigation.
“HSBC is committed to doing its part to address human trafficking, including sharing information that informs law enforcement and security services,” she told an event on tackling the issue, hosted by UK think-tank
April 2018

The Royal United Services Institute. The bank also wants to play its part in deepening cooperation between private and public sectors around the world, with robust sharing of information to tackle crime. “We all benefit from sharing ideas and techniques that help us best achieve this important objective,” she added.
Governance
A working group under Group Corporate Sustainability, drawing on resources from all functions, businesses and geographies, developed HSBC’s approach to reporting under the Modern Slavery Act. The recommendations of the working group were considered and accepted by the HSBC Holdings plc’s ESG Steering Committee and Disclosure Committee, and approved by the HSBC Holdings plc Board. Executive responsibility rests with the Group Management Board which has primary accountability for the businesses and functions relevant to particular human rights issues. This Statement is signed on behalf of the Board of Directors of HSBC Holdings plc by Group Chief Executive John Flint, 20 April 2018.

Our Modern Slavery Act 2015 Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.

Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking

As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we.

We have in place systems to:



Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.



Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.



Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.



Protect whistle blowers.



Where possible we build long standing relationships with local suppliers and make clear our

expectations of business behaviour;

Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to our staff.

Our effectiveness in combating slavery and human trafficking
The Act is relatively new legislation and few companies including CRISIL Entities have any experience of seeking out let alone detecting slavery or trafficking among their own staff or among those of their suppliers. To date CRISIL Entities are yet to detect or suspect that any CRISIL Entities or their suppliers employ persons who may be enslaved or trafficked, and so key performance indicators can only be set in respect of reasonable due diligence efforts once experience of the initial outputs of such exercises during 2016 are collated and analysed.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2018

Overview We take a zero-tolerance approach to breaches of our standards on modern slavery and human trafficking and we will always take action to investigate suspected incidences of modern slavery and to immediately address any confirmed incidences.
We are committed to ensuring that our operations, supply chains and the way we do business are aligned with our customer-led Ethical Policy and the values and ethics of the Co-operative Movement which define our brand. We work with our customers and suppliers to uphold the standards set out in our Ethical Policy, which include environmental sustainability, human rights and social responsibility.
As part of this commitment and in line with our regulatory obligations we publish this annual statement outlining the policies, procedures and training we have in place to prevent incidences of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and supply chains, investigating suspected incidences and how we address confirmed incidences. Currently, development of our policies relating to modern slavery and human trafficking is led by the Procurement and People functions however going forward there is scope to expand this further across the business.
Our approach to unethical or illegal activity in our business and supply chains begins with our customer-led Ethical Policy and the values and ethics of the Co-operative Movement, which drive our culture and are reinforced through our governance structure. Our customer-led Ethical Policy is founded on the co-operative values, which are embedded into the Articles of Association of our business ensuring they guide the management and conduct of the Bank. Compliance with the Ethical Policy and adherence to the co-operative values is overseen by the Values and Ethics Committee, which is a committee of the Board of the Bank.
Ethical Policy Our Ethical Policy has been in place for over 25 years and the most recent update was published in January 2015 and reflects over 320,000 customer and colleagues views. The Policy extends to cover key issues such as human rights, international development and tackling poverty. Our policy remains unique in UK banking and sets out how our business values and ethics shape the way we operate and the decisions we take. Read our full policy here:
co-operativebank.co.uk/assets/pdf/bank/aboutus/ ethicalpolicy/ethical-policy.pdf

Our supply chain With nearly 600 companies supplying a diverse range of goods and services, our supply chain helps us deliver services to all our customers and colleagues. It is important that our suppliers share our commitment to our customerled Ethical Policy and the values and ethics of the Co-operative Movement, which define our brand.
To ensure this we assess whether the operations of our suppliers are consistent with our Sustainable Procurement and Supplier Policy, which reflects our customer-led Ethical Policy.
Our Ethical Policy and Sustainable Procurement and Supplier Policy screening reviews all potential suppliers (over a turnover threshold of £250,000 or those in high-risk sectors) and all non-personal customers to ensure they are compatible with our Ethical Policy, before any commercial contracts are agreed, or services supplied.
 All suppliers are asked to complete a pre-qualification questionnaire, which requests information on a range of issues including labour standards.
 Compliance with our Sustainable Procurement and Supplier Policy forms part of the ongoing relationship with higher risk suppliers who are managed through the Bank's Supplier Management Framework.
The screening we carry out enables us to identify high risk supply chains by gathering information about their business, parent or subsidiary companies and the sectors and jurisdictions in which they operate, at the outset of our relationship.

The Co-operative Bank Holdings Limited & Co-operative Bank plc Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2018

What does the policy mean in practice? We periodically ask suppliers to confirm that they do not breach our Sustainable Procurement and Supplier Policy which sets out our expectations that a supplier’s core activities are sustainable, fair, legal and ethical. This includes a number of terms relating to labour standards. For example:
 Support the fundamental international labour organisation conventions and not engage in or support the use of forced labour, and recognise that workers should be free to terminate their employment after a reasonable agreed period of notice;
 Not engage in or support the use of child labour, and to provide specific consideration to young persons between the ages of 15 and 18, particularly in respect of their hours of work and safety;
 Meet legislative and industry standards pertaining to working hours, whichever afford the better protection, and ensure that employees shall not, on a regular basis, be expected to work for more than 48 hours per week.
Our tendering and contracting process In addition to our Sustainable Procurement and Supplier Policy, when we enter into a contract with a supplier, our standard terms and conditions require that suppliers:
 adhere to all applicable law
 remain in compliance with all relevant regulations, both at home and abroad
 comply with all customer policies concerning ethics, anti -bribery and/or anti-corruption as well as with any relevant industry code on anti-bribery.
Working with our suppliers Once a supplier is on boarded, our supplier management framework and third party supplier management policies set out how we will work with the supplier on a day-to-day basis and throughout the life of their contract. As part of the framework, we review suppliers against our Ethical Policy and Sustainable Procurement and Supplier Policy periodically. Suppliers identified as operating in geographies or industries which represent a higher risk, may be screened more often.
If breaches of basic standards occur, such as those involving corruption, fraud, bribery and modern slavery, we require suppliers to address these immediately. We expect action to be taken to investigate the conduct, remediate where possible, and ensure plans are put in place to avoid the situation recurring. Additionally we would always

report any suspected criminal activity to the relevant authorities in the UK or overseas.
During 2019 we will be working to introduce a Supplier Code of Conduct. We will require suppliers to operate in accordance with this and it will outline amongst other things, how we manage human rights, and the behaviours and practices we expect suppliers to demonstrate to ensure compliance with our policies.
Our colleagues and customers Our Ethical Policy sets out our commitment to be an ethical bank and workplace. This includes:
 Our commitment to paying the National Living Wage (as calculated by the Living Wage Foundation) and encouraging our contractors and suppliers to become Living Wage employers, and in doing so require our contractors to pay employees operating at our sites the UK Living Wage.
 We undertake an annual payroll audit to ensure all of our colleagues are being paid at least the Living Wage Foundation rate, including an audit of our employment suppliers’ payroll.
 Upholding the right of all employees to join a trade union if they wish.
 Ensuring co-operative values are embedded in our workplace culture.
Our resourcing policies When recruiting colleagues or working with employment agencies, we use a number of policies and procedures to ensure that, we always behave ethically and manage risk:
 All permanent, temporary and contractor recruitment is outsourced to a third party, although this will change in the future. As part of our recruitment policy we ensure that all recruitment contracts include reference to a Slavery and Human Trafficking policy that highlights a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and includes a commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all business dealings and relationships.

The Co-operative Bank Holdings Limited & Co-operative Bank plc Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2018

Identifying Money Laundering and the Proceeds of Crime We have a ‘three line’ approach to managing risk which includes our policies on Anti-Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime. These policies are intended to prevent the Bank from providing banking facilities to those engaged in illegal or criminal activities, which may also include modern slavery and human trafficking.
The Bank’s risk framework enables us to assess regulatory, legal and reputational risks and is overseen by the Risk Committee, which is a committee of the Board.
Training our colleagues We provide the following training to our colleagues to ensure our values and ethics remain embedded throughout our organisation:
 Code of Conduct - this sets out how we expect all colleagues to conduct themselves with other colleagues and wider stakeholders. The code helps ensure the Bank complies in full with its obligations and takes an appropriate attitude to risk. There is also a separate code that covers contractors and agency workers.
 We update both codes regularly to provide clarity on the roles and responsibilities of our leaders and colleagues, underpinned by our values and ethics. Everyone, whether a colleague, contractor or agency worker, is required to complete a mandatory e-learning module on the Code every year and to agree to comply with it and so uphold our values and ethics.
 The training and policies we have in place enable our colleagues to identify customers who may be money laundering or handing the proceeds of crime, which could arise from human trafficking or modern slavery.
 All our customer-facing colleagues receive training to help identify all forms of financial abuse, fraudulent activity and money laundering. The training covers how to engage in conversation with our customers and how to encourage them to disclose to us their circumstances and the support they need. This training is then reenforced with an annual e-learning module to embed the learning.
 We recognise that providing basic banking facilities to survivors is a life-line but that challenges around account opening and providing proof of identity and address can be a barrier. With this in mind, we have added more accepted documents to our process for example, letters of introduction and Home Office documents.

 Where customers need further support beyond their banking needs, we have provided funding for a dedicated resource at Citizens Advice Manchester, who will work with our particularly vulnerable customers. They are able to support a whole range of issues such as immigration, benefits etc.
Whistleblowing The Bank operates a Whistleblowing scheme, allowing employees to make an anonymous and confidential concern about the actions of business partners, managers and other employees. The scheme can be used for anything of concern including corruption, human rights violations and other areas of concern. These are then independently investigated.
Conclusion Throughout 2018 we have continued to demonstrate our commitment to our Ethical Policy and we publish our achievement each year in our Values and Ethics Report. You can read our latest report here:
co-operativebank.co.uk/assets/pdf/bank/news/valuesand-ethics-report-2018.pdf
The introduction of a Supplier Code of Conduct will be included in the 2019 Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking statement along with further information regarding the locations of where our goods and services are provided or manufactured from.
Additionally we believe our colleagues are equipped to identify all types of vulnerability within the customers they serve and our existing processes enable colleagues to refer customers to the most suitable source of support for their needs. Going forward we are committed to further strengthening our processes and raising the focus on this issue, by ensuring our colleagues understand the signs they need to look out for and how to offer support when needed.
We will also increase the focus within our Code of Conduct, mandatory training modules and induction programmes to maintain awareness of the issue with new and existing colleagues and strengthen our commitment to zero tolerance to modern slavery and human trafficking.

commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to
ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Following the publication of the Act, in 2016 we have strengthened our approach to ethical and responsible sourcing through a number of key initiatives.
All Suppliers and Manufacturers must submit a detailed Supplier Appraisal Assessment for approval as part of our pre-tender qualification process. We have
updated the appraisal forms to track the Country of manufacture allowing us to identify materials supplied by manufacturers with a high risk profile.
Our supply partners have to warrant that they shall comply and will use their best endeavours to ensure that any subcontractor or party within their own
supply chain shall at all times comply with the Act.
We have updated our Standard Purchase Order and Subcontractor Terms of Contract requiring trading partners to comply fully with the Act, with any breach
resulting in the termination of all live contracts.
The steps we have taken will help to:
O Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.
o Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.
o Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
O Protect whistle blowers.
SUPPLIER ADHERENCE TO OUR VALUES AND ETHICS
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values a Code of Conduct is
being developed that will be sent out annually requiring all suppliers and subcontractors to confirm their commitment
We have a dedicated compliance team, which consists of representatives from the following departments: Legal, Audit and Compliance, Human Resources,
Procurement and Sales.
TRAINING
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to
our staff. We also require our business partners to provide training to their staff and suppliers/providers
FURTHER STEPS
We will carry out a review exercise at least once a year to gauge the effectiveness of this policy and will look to ensure that we are adopting best practice
through the assessment of merging case law.

140,"Visa Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement
Introduction At Visa, our mission is to be the best way to pay and be paid, for everyone everywhere. As a global payments network, we stand for acceptance, security, convenience and universality and recognize the importance of respecting the rights of all individuals.
Visa is committed to operating responsibly and establishing high ethical standards across our company. We will not tolerate modern forms of slavery or human trafficking in our business.
The U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015 requires certain companies carrying on a business in the U.K. to publish a statement each year describing the steps taken to ensure modern forms of slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in the company’s business operations and supply chains.
In this FY16 Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement, we describe our business and our policies and practices on human rights, including human trafficking, in relation to our operations and supply chains.
Our business Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We operate one of the world's most advanced processing networks—VisaNet—that is capable of handling more than 65,000 transaction messages a second, with fraud protection for consumers and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers. Visa's digital payment platforms enable its clients—financial institutions and other payment service providers—to offer consumers more payment choices: pay now with debit, pay ahead of time with prepaid or pay later with credit.
Our structure Visa is headquartered in the San Francisco Bay area of California, U.S.A. Our company has offices in more than 90 locations around the world, organized into five geographic regions: Asia Pacific; Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa; Europe; Latin America & Caribbean; and North America. Visa operates CyberSource, an e-commerce payments gateway for merchants, in the United Kingdom primarily out of its UK subsidiary CyberSource Ltd. Our core payments business in the United Kingdom is operated primarily out of our Londonbased subsidiary Visa Europe Limited, which until June 16, 2016, was a separate company operating within Europe pursuant to an exclusive license from Visa. During FY16 we began the process of integrating the Europe business into the global Visa enterprise.
Our Principles Visa’s commitment to human rights includes those principles recognized in international human rights standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). During FY16, we engaged with a host of internal stakeholders to begin developing a formal statement of Visa’s views on human rights.
Visa also publishes a Corporate Responsibility Report that shares Visa’s approach to responsible and sustainable development. (The 2015 Report is available here.) Governance of Visa’s corporate responsibility commitments and performance occurs through a layered approach. Individual issue areas are handled by the relevant functions for each topic (e.g., Human Resources for compensation and benefits), with many rolling up to oversight by a particular internal committee as well as the Executive Committee. Our cross-function
1

Corporate Responsibility Working Group, co-chaired by our Head of Corporate Responsibility and Philanthropy and our Chief Counsel-Corporate, serves as a central coordinating body for our responsibility strategy, benchmarking and reporting. At the Board of Directors level, individual committees of the Board of Directors provide oversight of relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues as determined by each committee’s charter. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees and reviews Visa’s policies and programs concerning corporate responsibility.
Our policies Visa maintains a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code reflects our commitment to the highest ethical standards. Because every action and decision we make at all levels defines who we are as a company, our Code applies to everyone working with or on behalf of Visa, including employees, contingent staff, and our Board of Directors. The Code covers a wide range of topics relevant to the protection of human rights, including harassment and discrimination, workplace violence, protecting employee privacy, anti-money laundering/ATF/sanctions, and anti-bribery and anti-corruption. Visa’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available here.
Visa has other formal policies intended to promote ethical and legally compliant business conduct. Policies contributing to our commitment to prevent violations of human rights such as modern forms of slavery in our business include:
 Discrimination and Harassment Policy  Health and Safety Policy  Whistleblower and Non-Retaliation Policy  Sourcing Policies
Each year Visa staff are required to complete training on the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other policies relevant to their jobs.
Our supply chains Visa is committed to ensuring modern forms of slavery and human trafficking are not present in our supply chains and in our business. We expect our suppliers, vendors and contractors (“suppliers”) to respect human rights and promote similar principles in their own supply chains. In FY16 Visa began developing a new supplier code of conduct that will outline these human rights expectations, including those related to the prevention of modern forms of slavery, as well as other dimensions of ethical conduct.
Today Visa’s Master Services Agreements with its suppliers require compliance with all applicable law in the performance of the agreement. In addition, each Visa supplier is subject to a thorough due diligence process. Our review is tailored to the type of supplier and the activities the supplier will be performing for Visa, and may include background screening, sanctions screening, or review of anti-bribery controls, for example.
It is important to note that Visa does not manufacture goods or handle raw materials or commodities. As a technology company, our suppliers are concentrated around areas such as coding and development, marketing, consulting and operational procurement (e.g., office supplies, computers, software). In some cases, our supply chains are global, with suppliers selected to service the entire Visa enterprise. In other cases, our suppliers are local or regional, fulfilling the specific needs of our offices around the world. Following the 2016 acquisition of Visa Europe, our European supply chains are in the process of being integrated into the larger Visa procurement framework.
Our sourcing team Our Global Sourcing department supports the Visa organization by identifying the best-qualified suppliers, negotiating contracts to obtain best value for the service commitments we require, and partnering with our
2

business teams to help manage supplier risk. The Global Sourcing team will also be responsible for implementing, assessing and enforcing compliance with the forthcoming supplier code of conduct as part of a new supplier performance management process. During FY16 we began integrating our European and Global Sourcing operations. In support of the rollout of a new supplier performance management program, Visa Global Sourcing staff will receive training on the expectations set out in the supplier code of conduct. Global Sourcing staff also participate in standard Visa staff training on the Employee Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. Reporting Visa is committed to transparency in our approach to respecting human rights. Visa reports publicly on our progress, including through this annual Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement. *** This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the slavery and human trafficking statement for the Visa companies listed below for the financial year ending 30 September 2016.

legislation including the UK Modern Slavery Act and this is part of our due diligence process
when selecting suppliers.
Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that slavery and human trafficking form no part of our

of our objectives and have encouraged them to take leadership in this area;
if we discover indications that our business is being associated with illegal practices
(including prostitution and child exploitation) we will report such activity to the
police and bar any perpetrators from our premises; and
we will adjust our procurement policies and procedures to eliminate the possibility
of child labour, worker exploitation and human trafficking associated with the
general products and services we procure, with particular reference to sources of
cotton for linen and towels; sources of tea, coffee and sugar as well as other 'at risk'
foods; and, sources of jewellery and craft products.

142,"Sky’s Modern Slavery Statement

Sky is Europe’s leading entertainment company. The group serves 22 million customers across five countries: Italy, Germany, Austria, the UK and Ireland. We employ 30,000 people, and work with over 7,000 suppliers.
Our ethical, social and environmental standards are integral to our culture and key to the way we collaborate with our suppliers. We manage our own operations and supply chain through effective due diligence, risk assessment, training and collaboration with suppliers in order to ensure we help protect vulnerable groups of people.
Our annual risk assessment process across our operations and supply chains identifies focus areas relating to modern slavery issues .
Policies
We know that it’s our people that make Sky Europe’s leading entertainment company. We maintain a number of supporting policies available to employees which make reference to the risks associated to modern slavery. Sky’s Ways of Working defines our commitment to our customers, colleagues, shareholders, business partners, and the broader community. They set out our values as a business, make clear exactly what we expect of everyone who works at Sky and explain where to go for further help and advice, including how to raise concerns.
Our Employee Screening Process, Guidance on Right to Work and Temporary Worker Policy, are available to all employees. Internal training and articles on our intranet help inform employees.
Our Responsible Sourcing Policy is an integral part of all supplier contracts and reviewed annually. This sets out our expectations on areas such as compliance with all relevant legal requirements, including labour standards and practices and the prevention of bribery and corruption.
Supplier Due Diligence
Sky has a team of in-house experts that carry out due diligence on suppliers at the pre-qualification stage. This includes a range of issues, including bribery and corruption. This year we have also introduced a prequalification questionnaire that specifically addresses the risks of slavery and human trafficking and requests information about the due diligence mechanisms in place.
The team also oversee broader social, ethical and environmental management due diligence, which involves assessing our suppliers for their inherent risk using third party data provider Sedex (The Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) and Maplecroft (Global Risk Tool Provider). We require high inherent risk suppliers to complete an independent, self‑assessment questionnaire. This may be followed by subsequent SMETA audits (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audits), face-to-face meetings and capacity building.
We are committed to collaborating with suppliers and other stakeholders to raise working standards. We always choose to work with our suppliers to resolve any potential issues rather than terminating the supplier contract and leaving the issue unresolved.
We continue to embed clauses within our supplier contracts to include an explicit reference prohibiting forced and child labour. We include terms to ensure that the supplier signs up to and agrees with our policies in all legal contracts. We have adopted a new precedent agreement that we use for our approved suppliers of products and services. This includes updates to strengthen the supplier’s obligation to agree with our policies; the rights of inspection and audit rights.
Risk Assessment
We’ve completed a specific modern slavery risk assessment across our own operations and all our suppliers to understand where to focus attention. This has identified some key areas of the business on which to focus.

Our focus areas:
Our People
Sky employs 30,000 people directly and more through a number of business partners. We recognise that where workers are employed through business partners or recruitment agencies, we are not directly responsible for the employee relationship or how they manage their employees. To mitigate this risk we require certain contractual standards which are supported by the way we work.
Production
Sky produces its own programmes and commissions others from independent production companies. Services such as catering security and cleaning are often subcontracted and can be filled by a high proportion of migrant workers, making them potentially higher risk in relation to slavery and human trafficking.
Products
Sky manufactures a number of branded products, managed by close working relationships with suppliers around the world, particularly in China. Sky recognises that electronic manufacturing carries risks of poor recruitment and labour practices, especially in the developing world. In addition, there are risks with labour in product recycling and product logistics.
Property services
Sky’s property services include construction activities and outsourced services such as catering, security and cleaning. We recognise that roles in such industries tend to have a higher risk of poor labour conditions and visibility can be limited if the workforce is not employed by Sky directly.
For these areas there are action plans in place to better understand the nature of any risk and to implement supportive actions where necessary. Actions include updating contractual standards and supplier briefing packs through to direct supplier engagement and audits.
Tracking and Monitoring
The risk assessment process is undertaken annually and action plans are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Sky’s internal audit team conducts an annual check to ensure that reasonable mitigations are in place.
Grievance and Remedy
Sky employees have access to a confidential whistleblowing process for raising concerns. We continue to increase awareness among employees of issues related to slavery and human trafficking including ensuring the mechanisms available to our workforce are sufficiently known about, trusted and accessible. Our existing process aims to ensure individuals affected would not be victimised further and be provided access to counselling and support.
Governance
Sky has formal governance processes and committees in place for overseeing our responsible business commitments. In addition there is a steering group of representatives from across the business who identify risk and challenge insufficient information from suppliers, contractors and business partners.
The Bigger Picture Committee meets bi-annually and has responsibility for oversight of the social, environmental and ethical impacts of Sky’s activities.
This statement has been approved by the Board of Directors of Sky Plc.

1. Introduction
We, Aetna Insurance Company Limited and Aetna Global Benefits (UK) Limited, support the fundamental principles of human rights across our business and in each region where we have a presence. This is demonstrated through a commitment by management to adopt and embed ethical standards internally and externally, and to implement policies and processes that reinforce this. We adhere to applicable laws and this includes laws that apply to contractors and suppliers such as the anti-human trafficking provisions of the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015.
Accordingly, we will not tolerate modern slavery whether in our business or in those organizations that we engage or conduct business with. To that end this statement, made pursuant to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 outlines the steps we are taking to mitigate the potential risk of modern slavery occurring in our business and supply chains.
2. Our organization
We are part of the Aetna International group of companies which provides international private medical insurance to customers across the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia and we have over 1,500 staff working across these regions. We provide our products to individuals, small/medium enterprises and large corporate businesses through agents, brokers, corporate partners and directly.
Please visit our website at www.aetnainternational.com to find out more.
3. Our controls
We are committed to operating and conducting our business in a way that promotes corporate ethics and respect for human rights. Accordingly, our statement reflects this commitment, and details the policies and procedures we have put in place to support it. These include:
• CVS Health Code of Conduct - Our Code of Conduct is grounded in and reflects the principles of CVS Health Corporation, our ultimate shareholder. The Code guides our compliance with the rules and regulations that govern our business throughout the world. Compliance with our Code and other regulatory requirements is everyone’s responsibility, from the top to the bottom of our organization. We not only expect this commitment of our staff, but we also expect our contractors and subcontractors to maintain comparable policies and practices. We provide annual training to all employees on business conduct & integrity (including coverage of key aspects of the Code).
• CVS Health Human Rights Policy: We uphold the fundamental principle of human rights and adhere to widely accepted standards of fair treatment and non-discrimination including those set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We are committed to respect the human rights of our employees through our internal employment policies and practices as highlighted below. We also seek to encourage behavior by our suppliers that is consistent with the principles set forth in our human rights policy.
1
Proprietary

• Aetna International third-party payment policy: We have adopted due diligence procedures to enable the identification and mitigation of financial crime and corruption risk. As part of this process we conduct several checks at the onboarding stage of a third-party business relationship and annually thereafter to ensure that our suppliers meet certain legal, regulatory and other ethical standards. In the last year, we have also taken steps to incorporate specific modern slavery checks and contractual provisions within our third-party/vendor due diligence and engagement processes.
• Aetna International procedures for raising concerns: We:
o encourage employees to report suspected wrongdoing as soon as possible, secure in the knowledge that we will take their concerns seriously and investigate them as appropriate, and that we will respect their confidentiality;
o provide employees with established reporting channels (including those that maintain anonymity) and give guidance on how to raise concerns;
o reassure employees that they are able to raise genuine concerns without fear of reprisals, even if they turn out to be mistaken.
This ensures that employees are encouraged and able to report concerns in relation to the violation of human rights or any breach of the Code, our company policies or relevant laws without fear of retribution.
• Aetna International employment policy: Our employees are the face of the business as such we expect our employees to conduct themselves with honesty, integrity and maintain high standards in accordance with the Code when representing the business and in their day to day engagements. In the same light, we are committed to protecting and respecting the human rights of our employees through internal employment policies and practices. Our employment policy promotes equal opportunity and diversity and inclusion and the commitment to equal opportunity governs decisions related to all aspects of employment, including recruitment, selection, development and compensation. To that end, we ensure that employees are not discriminated against on the basis of their age, sex, nationality, religion or marital status. In addition, our compensation philosophy is to reward employees for their contributions to our business success through pay structures that reflect local market conditions. This philosophy ensures that we are positioned to attract, retain and motivate our employees and we also ensure that our employees work in a conducive environment.
• Contractual protection: As part of our contracting processes, our legal team seeks to insert “compliance with law” clauses as appropriate into contracts with third parties that we deal with. This is intended to encompass any employment/labor, human trafficking and slavery laws applicable in the jurisdictions concerned. Where appropriate, we endeavor to include specific slavery / trafficking prohibitions.
4. Further Actions
As part of our commitment to addressing modern slavery in our business and supply chains, we have reviewed our policies and procedures to identify any areas of enhancement to further support:
2
Proprietary

• identification, monitoring and assessment of potential modern slavery risk in our business and supply chains;
• reduction of such risk; and • reporting of concerns in respect of the same. As an outcome of this review, over the next 12 months we intend to improve our current controls further by enhancing our internal guidance and the content of our annual training to assist our employees with the identification of modern slavery and our approach in relation to the same. 5. Conclusion Our management team and the Boards of Directors of our companies have overall responsibility for ensuring that we comply with our legal and ethical obligations (including the above-mentioned policies), and that all our employees comply with it. We have procedures in place to monitor compliance with these policies and to identify areas of non-compliance. We assess non-compliance and complete appropriate remedial action (including any external reporting). We are committed to ensuring our employees are able to recognize and respond to the risks of modern slavery in our business and supply chains, and we will continue to review our procedures/ policies to ensure that they adequately support this objective. This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and Aetna Insurance Company Limited and Aetna Global Benefits (UK) Limited have adopted it as their slavery and human trafficking statement following the financial year ending 31 December 2018.

144,"MODERN SLAVERY ACT TRANSPARENCY STATEMENT
Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement made on behalf of Coventry Building Society
and its subsidiaries Godiva Mortgages Limited and ITL Mortgages Limited further to
section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
ORGANISATION'S STRUCTURE AND BUSINESS
Coventry Building Society is a financial services provider based in Coventry, United Kingdom.
The Society provides retail savings products, and the Society and its wholly owned
subsidiaries Godiva Mortgages Limited and ITL Mortgages Limited (together ""the Society')
provide mortgage products. The Society does not have a presence outside the United
Kingdom.
The Society has been looking after our members' finances for over 130 years, and today we
are proud of our record as one of the UK's strongest building societies. We are now the
second largest building society in the UK with assets in excess of £40 billion, serving over 1.8
million members and employing over 2,400 staff. We provide competitive savings and
mortgage products to our members, jobs and career development for our employees, and
social and economic benefits to our local communities.
The simplicity of our business model, focussing as it does purely on savings and residential
mortgages means that we do not lend to businesses and do not have exposure to ""high risk'
sectors.
THE SOCIETY'S SUPPLY CHAINS
The Society does not manufacture any goods. The Society's suppliers support our Functions,
and the retail financial services we provide to members and customers. The suppliers are
subject to due diligence checks before we enter into contracts, as well as regular ongoing risk
monitoring.
All the Society's call centres are UK-based and operated by the Society, and the majority of
the Society's suppliers are also UK based.
OUR APPROACH TO SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
The Society has zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking and is committed to taking all
reasonable steps to ensure that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply
chains or in any part of our business.
Because of the nature of the Society's business and its supply chains, following careful
consideration, we consider that the risk of the presence of slavery or human trafficking in our
supply chains is low. However, the Society is not complacent in relation to these issues.
Our policy is to require all our suppliers to comply with applicable legal requirements,
including in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking. The Society's Procurement
Policy states:
Modern Slavery - Suppliers will ensure that employees are treated fairly and ethically, and
that there is no slavery, servitude, forced/compulsory labour, or human trafficking.
Forced Labour - Suppliers will not use any forced labour, which means any work or service
performed involuntarily under threat of physical or other penalty. Suppliers shall respect the
freedom of movement of its workers and not restrict their movement by controlling identity
papers, holding money deposits, or taking any other action to prevent workers from
terminating their employment.
Child Labour - Suppliers will not directly (or indirectly through the use of its subcontractors)
employ any children under the age of 16.
Diversity and Inclusion - Suppliers will hire, compensate, promote, discipline, and provide
other conditions of employment based solely on an individual's performance and ability to do
the job. Suppliers will not discriminate based on a person's race, gender, age, nationality,
marital status, ethnic origin, or any legally protected status"".
When bidding for new appointments, suppliers are required to confirm their compliance with
these requirements.
Following appointment, we operate a programme of supplier relationship management
activities. Where any concerns arise, a full assessment is made and appropriate actions are
taken to address those concerns.
We see our approach to Procurement and Supplier Relationship Management as an effective
measure in carrying out our zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking.
TRAINING OUR COLLEAGUES
We provide all of our colleagues with training that's relevant to them. We also ensure our
management teams have additional support which includes guidance to make sure our
recruitment process is consistent and our approach to managing suppliers is effective. We
have given, and will continue to give, extra training to colleagues who regularly work with and
have a level of operational responsibility for managing our third party suppliers on the Modern
Slavery Act 2015.
WHAT WE INTRODUCED THROUGHOUT 2018
The 2018 Procurement Strategy outlined the increased commitment to socially responsible
sourcing. The following steps have been applied throughout 2018, and will continue to be
enhanced throughout 2019:
Supplier Selection
Before we engage with a third party supplier we ask a series of ""Gateway questions""
which formally confirm compliance with modern day slavery requirements during the
Procurement process. In particular, the new third party supplier is asked to confirm
that neither it nor any of its suppliers use, or are in any way connected with, slave
labour, human trafficking or exploitation, or any other activity which would constitute
an abuse of human rights.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) now comprise an element of the supplier
assessment process undertaken by Procurement.
An initiative to streamline our supplier due diligence process has begun. Part of this
initiative will include a higher assessment on CSR requirements when on boarding
suppliers. This initiative is scheduled to take place throughout July 2019.
Contracting
Society's template contract includes supplier obligations for modern day slavery
compliance.
Monitoring
Monitoring of the ""Gateway questions"" has taken place throughout 2018 and all
required suppliers have accepted our CSR terms. No concerns or issues have been
identified within the Society's supplier base throughout 2018.
Next Steps
We regularly review our approach to tackling modern slavery. This helps us engage with
suppliers to identify any ethical trading issues and incidents of modern slavery or human
trafficking and take appropriate action.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes the Society's slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year
ending 31 December 2018.

Statement on Slavery and Human Trafficking March 2018
Introduction
OP Chocolate Ltd (hereafter “OP” or “OP Chocolate”) strongly opposes slavery and human trafficking and rejects any form of forced labour. This statement establishes our commitment to understanding the risks and ensuring there is no modern slavery occurring in our business or supply chains. A global human trafficking and forced labour risks assessment of our supply chain has indicated that some of our operations in Ivory Coast for cocoa purchasing requires a stronger monitoring. This statement relates to the financial year January to December 2017.
Organisational Structure and Supply chains
OP Chocolate Ltd is located in South Wales and is owned by CEMOI Group, whose head office is based in France. As a chocolate and chocolate based confectionery producer OP’s supply chain begins in cocoa producing regions such as The Ivory Coast where CEMOI Group is actively developing and leading sustainable development programmes such as ‘Transparence Cocoa’. OP Chocolate sources various other raw materials and where possible these are sourced locally from Wales and other parts of the UK. OP’s customers are retail businesses. A large proportion of OP’s key customers are part of the Stronger Together initiative promoting the issue of Modern Slavery.
Responsibility
The Managing Director has responsibility for leading the company Modern Slavery initiatives. The senior management team has responsibility for developing and promoting these initiatives for the future both internally and throughout the supply chain. The HR Manager has responsibility for communicating and implementing the initiatives throughout the business.
Steps in place
CEMOI manage human trafficking and forced labour risks with our cocoa bean suppliers by : 1st compliance level : for all our cocoa bean suppliers in Ivory Coast, CEMOI has implemented an ethical cocoa bean code of conduct. 2nd compliance level : in addition, for the last 7 years, CEMOI has developed an innovative sustainable development programme (‘Transparence Cocoa’ which represents around 30% of our total cocoa bean purchasing) with additional training and support actions of cocoa communities in tackling human trafficking and forced labour risks. As for our UK chocolate operations, OP Chocolate Ltd has undertaken a SMETA audit (ethical trade audit for SEDEX members) of itself which tested 2 pillars, Labour Standards and Health and Safety against UK legislation, good practice as defined by SEDEX and the ETI base code. OP Chocolate Ltd has established a requirement for all suppliers to link on SEDEX to assess the risk level or to complete a supplier questionnaire, clarifying relevant practices. Those identified as high risk will be required to communicate to OP the steps they will carry out to then reduce the risk and ensure incidences of Modern Slavery are not occurring. OP Chocolate conducts twice yearly audits of its agency labour provider which includes agency labour surveys and investigative interviews. In order to raise awareness of slavery and human trafficking, all factory staff undergo training on Stronger Together principles involving how to identify and report possible occurrences. Posters and leaflets are displayed throughout the site on the subject and available support. Bruce Tomlinson Managing Director

“HOW WE DO BUSINESS IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE BUSINESS WE DO.” Marriott International’s Executive Chairman, J.W. Marriott, Jr.’s belief describes our pledge to conduct business in an ethical manner and commitment to responsible business values. The Marriott brands are on over 6,500 managed and franchised properties in 127 countries and territories around the world. This statement applies to Marriott International, Inc.’s corporate offices, managed, leased and owned hotels. We work with and encourage our owners and franchise partners to adopt similar policies within their businesses. Marriott’s Business Conduct Guide, available in 15 languages reinforces the importance of our corporate values and ethical responsibility, can be found here. An overview of our business and corporate structure can be found on our corporate website here.
OUR HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY AND PRINCIPLES OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS At Marriott, we are committed to demonstrating our core values and a company culture that represent the highest standards of guest and associate experience, ethics, integrity and corporate citizenship which is reflected in our Principles of Responsible Business. In 2006, we published our Human Rights Policy establishing a foundation for managing our business around the world in accordance with all applicable laws. Since then we have continued to enhance related internal policies. In 2017, we enhanced our Human Rights Policy to integrate criteria on ethical recruitment. Marriott’s Human Rights Policy and Principles are guided by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and Sustainable Development Goals, as well as related international covenants. Our collective efforts on human rights are outlined in our Commitment of Human Rights statement. We recognize the important role of business to respect human rights and work together with other stakeholders to address global human rights challenges such as modern slavery, human trafficking and the exploitation of children.

GOVERNANCE AND DUE DILIGENCE Marriott’s work on human rights, including human trafficking, is overseen by an internal Human Rights Council that represents global leaders across multiple business disciplines. This Council is co-chaired by our Social Impact Group and Human Resources Department. Marriott also has a dedicated Director-level corporate associate who has expertise on and is responsible for human rights issues.
Marriott implements an ongoing risk management process to identify, prevent and mitigate relevant human rights risks. Our internal audit department conducts an annual Ethical Conduct Survey across a broad section of associates, including all officers and senior managers. We provide associates with a variety of means, including anonymous channels, to report unethical behaviour. This includes a toll-free international Business Integrity Hotline. The Company does not tolerate any retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith and has policies in place to protect such individuals.
For the past twenty years, Marriott has implemented a crisis reporting protocol that includes a twenty-four hour Crisis Hotline managed by independent third parties and available to global properties to access. For example, Marriott implements the Marriott Incident Reporting Application (MIRA), which is an online system for gathering and reporting security-related incidents, including human trafficking, for properties managed by Marriott outside of the U.S. These managed properties are required to enter incidents into MIRA within 24 hours after the incident occurred or was reported. Critical incidents, including suspicious activity around human trafficking, are flagged by the system for follow-up and investigated by regional Global Safety and Security Directors.
In 2017, we added new criteria to our internal property certification audit to survey the compliance with the new human trafficking awareness training requirement. These audits are conducted on a biannual basis to ensure that our properties are meeting specific requirements.
OUR EFFORTS TO PREVENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING In 2017, we launched a new sustainability and social impact platform called Serve 360, with specific goals about human trafficking prevention. Under our Serve 360 platform, one of our four priorities is to Welcome All and Advance Human Rights. By 2025, we have set a goal that 100 percent of on-property associates at managed and franchised hotels will have completed our human rights awareness programme, including training on human trafficking awareness, responsible sourcing and recruitment policies and practices. We have also set a 2025 Goal to enhance or embed human rights criteria in our recruitment and sourcing policies and work with our industry to address human rights risks in the hotel construction phase.
● HUMAN RIGHTS AWARENESS PROGRAMME: In 2016, we rolled out comprehensive human trafficking training addressing human trafficking, child exploitation and forced labour available in 15 languages. The purpose of the training “Your Role in Preventing Human Trafficking: Know the Signs” is to raise awareness of all forms of human trafficking and educate associates on the indicators and what they can do should they suspect potential issues. At the beginning of 2017, we made human trafficking awareness training a requirement for all on-property associates across both managed and franchised properties. Within the first three months of mandating human trafficking training for associates, two reported cases of human trafficking were brought to hotel management’s attention and led directly to the rescuing of victims. At year-end 2017, a total of 243,000 associates globally had completed human trafficking awareness training.

● SUPPLY CHAIN SUSTAINABILITY: Marriott collaborates with suppliers in three channels of our supply chain— furniture, fixture and equipment (FF&E), operating supplies and equipment (OS&E) and food and beverage (F&B)—as part of our overall sustainability strategy. Marriott encourages its suppliers and contractors around the world to adopt the same ethical business standards and human rights compliance it supports. Global contracts currently executed by Marriott require contractors to comply with Marriott’s Global Procurement Supplier Conduct Guidelines, which is available in multiple languages and sent out to suppliers as part of a continent-wide awareness campaign and includes standards on forced labour consistent with the Company’s Human Rights Policy.

Associates with procurement and purchasing responsibilities are required to complete our Procurement 101 online training, which includes information on our human rights policies. In 2017, approximately 10,280 associates globally completed the training.

● ETHICAL RECRUITMENT: Marriott recognizes that some individuals may try to exploit and fraudulently recruit potential employees on behalf of our Company. In an effort to raise awareness of and prevent recruitment scams, we have developed guidance for jobseekers and a list of approved Marriott e-mail domains that can be found here. Marriott managed hotels do not require payment of a fee to be considered for employment. We also do not accept job applications via email or fax. Our complete statement on recruitment scams can be found here. In 2017, we updated our Human Rights policy to specify our “no fees” recruitment policy.

● GLOBAL SAFETY AND SECURITY: Since 2011, an internal training developed by Marriott called Human Rights and the Protection of Children has been included in the company’s Loss Prevention Certification programme available to security staff at non-U.S. managed hotels. Human trafficking is also included in our training “Security is Everyone’s Responsibility” which is available in English and Spanish. In the U.K., each managed hotel has a Safety and Security Champion trained on the signs of human trafficking.

EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND PROGRAMMES Marriott engages and collaborates with strategic external partners to support and develop programmes that address the root causes of exploitation. Through some of these programmes, we also help vulnerable people prepare for and find meaningful employment.
Marriott continues to support and promote global efforts to prevent human trafficking through our engagement with our industry peers and diverse organizations focused on human rights, including collaborative efforts to address human trafficking:

● INTERNATIONAL TOURISM PARTNERSHIP: Marriott is a founding member of the International

Tourism Partnership (ITP). Through our membership, we collaborate with other global hospitality

companies to address critical issues that affect our industry and actively contribute to key industry

initiatives such as the creation of the Industry Position Statement on Human Trafficking, Supply Chain

Working Group risk-mapping which highlighted agency and construction workers as a high-risk area for

trafficking, and internal and external stakeholder surveys and engagement. In 2017, Marriott contributed

to the development of new industry human rights goals to prevent forced labour and human trafficking in

support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as part of ITP’s human rights working

group with can be found here.

● NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS: For over 20 years, Marriott has offered the Youth Career Initiative (YCI), a 24-week education and life enhancing programme for young people at risk, at our hotels in nine countries and territories within Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. To date, thousands of students have graduated from YCI programmes around the world and have gone on to pursue careers in hospitality, banking and health care, or have continued with further education. More than 1,100 of those graduates were trained at Marriott hotels, including students who are survivors of human trafficking.
Marriott has collaborated with End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes (ECPAT-USA) and Polaris to co-develop the content of our comprehensive human trafficking awareness training. We continue to partner with the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AH&LA) to make the training widely available to other hospitality companies and academia; the proceeds from the training are donated back to ECPAT-USA and Polaris. In 2017, we added ECPAT and Polaris as strategic partners to our Marriott Rewards platform to educate our customers on modern day slavery.
● PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS: In January 2017, the state of Connecticut established the Marriott human trafficking awareness training, which was co-developed with ECPAT-USA, as the state’s standard for its 2016 human trafficking law. As a result of this partnership, nearly 500 hoteliers in Connecticut received free human trafficking awareness training through the Quinnipiac Law School.
In 2018, we will continue to implement our human trafficking awareness programme requirement for managed and franchised properties. We will collaborate with external expert organizations to identify ways our company can contribute to fight human trafficking and work with our peer colleagues and the broader hospitality industry on efforts to address human rights issues within our sphere of influence. We will also continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our policies and operating procedures to comply with all relevant laws.
This statement has been reviewed and approved by our UK Board of Directors and signed off by Amy McPherson, President for Europe, Marriott Hotels Ltd.

ESPRIT

ESPRIT’S DISCLOSURE STATEMENT CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS
ACT AND UK ANTI-SLAVERY ACT OF 2015 ——————
Esprit strives to maintain the highest ethical, social and ecological business standards. This fundamental principle is at the core of Esprit’s values and is embodied in our Code of Conduct. Esprit applies our Code of Conduct throughout our supply chain and provides detailed written guidance on its implementation. As an international brand with presence in multiple countries, Esprit’s supply chain extends across a wide area. Information about Esprit’s organization is available here.
In the apparel industry, the highest risk of human trafficking is for purposes of forced labor and forced child labor, though Esprit recognizes that other forms of human trafficking are possible in uncommon circumstances. Esprit’s Code of Conduct establishes standards that guard against all forms of forced and child labor with specific prohibitions against compulsory labor, bonded labor, indentured labor, the payment of deposits and guarantees, and the retention of workers’ documents.
At the time of this disclosure, Esprit does not have a specific guidance against human trafficking, but considers it as a sub-set of forced labor. Besides being addressed under its Voluntary Employment standard, human trafficking is considered by Esprit under its Legal Compliance standard as an “illegal activity” and is thus considered a zero tolerance issue, if found. Moreover, Esprit is a member of the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), and the BSCI Code has specific prohibitions against trafficked labor. Esprit plans to add more specific language and guidance regarding human trafficking to its Code in 2017.
Esprit recognizes that the apparel industry’s key risk of forced labor relates to the use of foreign contract labor, where workers from one country are recruited to work in another for a fixed period of time, usually through one or more labor brokers or labor facilitators. This problem is complex and systemic, and is rooted in the highly corrupt and deliberately opaque cross-border recruitment system. Esprit recognizes that, as one company operating independently, it has no leverage to respond effectively to this issue in a way that would have significant impact. Esprit has established a policy of not working with factories that use foreign contract labor, seeking instead to create jobs in workers’ home countries by producing its products there.
Should Esprit find foreign contract workers in an existing factory, however, it maintains strong guidelines for the treatment and protection of foreign contract workers, including a requirement that the employer/supplier factory pay for ALL recruitment costs related to their recruitment and hiring, and prohibitions against recouping these costs through salary deductions, deposits, inflating the cost of accommodations and other employer-provided services, and/or any other means.

VERIFICATION
Esprit’s Code of Conduct guides the actions and decisions of all of Esprit’s employees and business partners, and applies to all stages of its supply chain. Esprit looks for suppliers that are willing to work toward improvements, have no serious violations, and are fully engaged in the issues that the Code of Conduct seeks to address
One hundred per cent of Esprit’s Tier 1 (direct) suppliers are assessed before order placement. Esprit holds its vendors/suppliers responsible for assuring that their next-tier suppliers are in full compliance with Esprit’s Code. As an additional control, Esprit requires all sub-contractors to be approved by Esprit in writing and materials suppliers to be disclosed in advance. This enhances the company’s visibility to workplace practices in its supply chain beyond Tier 1.
Esprit does not currently verify its labor supply chain specifically for foreign contract workers, as existing policies make the risk of workers hired cross-border through labor brokers miniscule and, if it happens, immediately manageable.

SUPPLIER AUDITS
Esprit’s Code of Conduct Audit Program includes both audits and issue remediation assistance. To implement its Code of Conduct Audit Program, Esprit relies on its membership in the Business Social

Compliance Initiative (BSCI) and the International Labor Organization’s Better Work Program (ILO-BWP), where ILO BWP exists (Cambodia, Vietnam, Jordan and Bangladesh). Both are well-recognized audit programs. Participation in such industry-wide programs helps reduce duplication and increase the leverage of labor and social compliance audit efforts through the sharing of audit information by participating companies. Esprit also conducts internal audits to supplement these external programs.
BSCI audits are conducted by third-party auditors. Esprit’s Social Compliance staff works closely with appointed BSCI auditors to ensure understanding of Esprit’s and the BSCI’s codes of conduct and standardize and maximize information gathering. Audit methodology includes a review of internal management systems (including management interviews and documents review), and worker interviews.
Esprit’s global Social and Environmental Sustainability Department directly monitors corrective action after audits are completed, as well as all other efforts to assist suppliers towards continuous improvement on Code of Conduct performance.
Audits of active suppliers are conducted annually. From July 2014-June 2015, for example, 531 Esprit suppliers (or 95 percent of all supplier factories) were audited. The majority of audits are semiannounced, with managers knowing an audit will come within a 1-month window of time. However, Esprit reserves the right to conduct unannounced audits where deemed necessary.
CERTIFICATION
All Esprit suppliers must demonstrate knowledge of social compliance, and an awareness of where they fall short, before they can be on-boarded to produce Esprit products or provide services to Esprit. Any factory or vendor that wishes to work with Esprit must produce a current BSCI Audit Report with an A, B or C rating, a recent Better Work Audit Report with a Corrective Action Plan, or other select audit reports that Esprit may accept on a case-by-case basis. Once on-boarded, suppliers without a BSCI audit report, or a Better Work audit report, must obtain one within a prescribed period.
INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY
Esprit generally tries to work with suppliers to resolve compliance issues uncovered by audits. However, where remediation efforts fail, or an issue is exceptionally severe or deemed irremediable, Esprit may take action up to and including suspension and/or termination of business with a supplier. “Human trafficking” falls under “illegal activity”, which Esprit considers a zero-tolerance indicator, and will be cause for immediate termination of business with appropriate procedures in place for the protection of and reparation to victims.
Esprit encourages its employees, business partners and suppliers to report issues/non-compliances to its Code of Conduct through a confidential complaints mechanism. Esprit commits to evaluate all reports and take corrective action if non-compliances are verified. Its Code of Conduct Implementation Guidelines require its suppliers to establish effective, multi-channel grievance mechanisms that workers can access in confidence to report non-compliances to its Code.
TRAINING
Esprit conducts annual Vendor Summits to maintain constant dialogue with its supply chain partners and ensure understanding of the company’s expectations.
To equip its employees, business partners and suppliers with sufficient knowledge regarding its Code of Conduct, and particularly its Voluntary Employment and No Child Labor requirements, Esprit has issued a Social Compliance Standards Manual that explains its standards and provides guidance on good practices for each standard/requirement.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the steps that IFL has taken and is continuing to take to ensure modern slavery or human trafficking is not taking place within our operations and supply chain during the financial year ending 30 September 2018.
1. Overview We live in a world full of opportunities in financial markets but not a world of full access. We believe that every company – regardless of size, regardless of industry, regardless of how long they’ve been in business – deserves access to the best advice, the best products, and the best, most efficient market access. We’re INTL FCStone – a pioneer in diverse, global financial services. We believe that no one should have a monopoly on opportunity and carrying it out in an ethical way is one of our most important values. We recognise that modern slavery such as forced labour and human trafficking are a growing global concern, and therefore outline the steps we are taking across IFL to mitigate the potential risk of modern slavery occurring in our business and supply chain.
2. Organisation structure IFL is a wholly owned subsidiary of INTL, a Fortune 500 company with its head office in the United States of America that focuses on select international and domestic financial markets. IFL provides financial services specifically in the foreign exchange and commodities sector. • The global payments division delivers 146 currencies to more than 180 countries for international aid and development organizations, UN agencies, government agencies, NGO's, religious entities, multinational corporations, and financial institutions. • As a Category 1 member of the London Metal Exchange, we provide hedging services for customers in base metals, soft, agricultural and other commodities. • As a full member of London Bullion Market Association and an associate member of the London Platinum and Palladium Markets Association, we provide hedging and physical trading services in precious metals. • Acts as broker in foreign exchange, oil and precious metals, acting as principal and intermediary. • Provide hedging advice to clients in agricultural, energy, and dairy sectors. We have over 270 employees and operate primarily in Europe, Middle East, Asia and Australia through other subsidiaries of INTL. Our annual turnover is approximately $199 million.
3. Supply Chain Most of IFL’s the activities do not involve physical delivery of commodities. However, for the business where physical delivery is involved, IFL holds business relationships with companies situated at various levels of the supply chain and include banks, financial institutions, mines, refineries or intermediaries.

4. Our Policy in relation to slavery and human trafficking IFL is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-slavery Policy (Policy), which is available on request, reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in out supply chains.
5. Due diligence processes It is important that our suppliers share our commitment to human rights, as part of our initiative to identify and mitigate modern slavery we verify our clients such that we can easily identify possible risks that may be associated with proposed clients or relationships. We have in place systems to: • Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains. All precious metals suppliers are subject to additional reviews during onboarding which include questionnaires designed to identify and assess the risks of modern slavery supplier relationship activities. In addition, for mines & refineries, IFL would analyse working conditions, environmental standards, CSR initiatives, etc. • Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains with ongoing annual reviews and checks to ensure ethical behaviours and industry codes of practice are followed. • Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains. • Report any instances or suspicions of slavery, human trafficking, or other unethical behaviour via the whistleblowing hotline. Whistle blowers are protected from being treated unfairly or losing their job.
6. Key performance indicators to measure effectiveness of steps being taken We use the following key performance indicators to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains: • Level of communication and personal contact with the next link in the supply chain and their compliance with our expectations. • Integrating slavery and human trafficking into our client and supplier engagement processes.
7. Training on modern slavery and trafficking IFL’s anti-slavery policy is refreshed annually and its integration into the business is supported by a mandatory training module to ensure that employees are aware of and understand the content.

Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement

Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement
This statement is made by BlackRock Group Limited on behalf of itself and relevant BlackRock group UK subsidiaries that are subject to the requirements of section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2018.
 BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited (“BIMUK”)  BlackRock Advisors (UK) Limited (“BAL”)  BlackRock Fund Managers Limited (“BFM”)  BlackRock International Limited (“BIL”)  BlackRock Life Limited (“BLL”)  BlackRock Asset Management Investor Services Limited (“BAMIS”)  BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, National Association
Our ultimate parent is BlackRock Inc. and we form part of its group of companies. In this statement references to “BlackRock” mean BlackRock Inc. and its subsidiaries and references to “we”, “our” or “us” mean the entities making this statement.
1. Background
Under section 54 of the Act, commercial organisations that supply goods or services, carry on business in the UK and meet the annual turnover threshold of at least £36m from the provision of goods and services must publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement for financial years ending on or after 31 March 2017. Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
2. Our Business
BlackRock is the leading global asset manager, serving many of the world's largest companies, pension funds, foundations, and public institutions as well as millions of people from all walks of life. Approximately 15,000 colleagues in BlackRock work from 70 offices in 30 countries, helping people from all walks of life around the world to reach their investing goals. BlackRock does this by providing investment advice and managing investment strategies across one of the deepest, broadest investment platforms in the financial services industry. As a fiduciary for its clients and as a public company, BlackRock’s focus is long-term sustainability. BlackRock aims to be a responsible corporate citizen and to take into account environmental, social and governance issues that have real and quantifiable financial impacts over the long-term for BlackRock and the firms in which BlackRock invests. Long-term responsibility and sustainability are integrated into BlackRock’s business model and shareholder value creation framework and in the way BlackRock conducts its business, serves its clients and gives back to the communities in which BlackRock and its clients live and work.
We consider that given the nature of the services that we offer that the risk of involvement in modern slavery and human trafficking is low.
Steps we have taken to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place in our organisation or supply chains include the following:
We have a robust recruitment and onboarding process with multiple checks built in to ensure all

Our Group Responsible Financing Standard (Standard), which was introduced in 2017,
provides guidance on assessing environmental, social and governance risks (ESG) for all
credit applications, periodic credit reviews (including where specific triggers are breached),
and capital markets transactions. The Standard is supplemented by our eight Sector Guides
Under the Standard, we have an established ESG risk assessment approach which includes
screening to prevent contributing to forced labour and modern slavery practice in our lending
portfolio. Among others, we will not knowingly finance activities involving child or forced labour
and human rights abuses. In 2019, we further strengthened our ESG risk assessment process
which also evaluates the risk of customer operations affecting livelihoods, involving
resettlement, or demonstrating poor labour working conditions as these may create situations
which bring about slavery. Around 4.4% (four point four percent) of ESG risk assessments
conducted for large corporation customers were escalated for enhanced due diligence.
Our ESG risk assessment framework is aligned to international best practices, including the
World Bank Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines and International Labour
Organization (ILO) Conventions and Recommendations. Notably, in November 2019, we
signed up to the Equator Principles (EPs), which outline rigorous social and environmental
standards for large-scale developments. Adoption of the EPs will further strengthen our risk
management of modern slavery issues in financed projects.

completed ESG training using our eLearning module, representing 97% (ninety seven percent)
completion rate; and a total of 772 (seven hundred seventy two) employees from our core
markets have undergone ESG training in a classroom-based setting.
In 2019, we introduced a new training module for our RMs and CRMs specifically on human
trafficking and modern-day slavery. Three training sessions of this module were conducted
with our Know-Your-Customer (KYC) team and we trained 628 (six hundred twenty eight) RMs.
The objective was to raise internal awareness and enhance our understanding of the early-
warning signals and relevance of modern slavery to our business.
We will continue with our training programmes to equip our staff with the knowledge and tools
We aim to partner with suppliers who adopt good ethical, professional and legal standards.
DBS Sustainable Sourcing Principles (SSP) outline our expectations of suppliers in four key
areas - human rights (which includes human trafficking and slavery), safety and health,
environmental sustainability and business integrity and ethics.
Since 2015, all new suppliers in Singapore who engage with DBS Bank are required to sign up
to the SSP and acknowledge that they will conduct their business in compliance with
applicable laws, including those dealing with modern slavery. In 2019, 99.9% (ninety nine point
nine percent) of our new suppliers have signed their commitment to our SSP.
In 2017, we rolled out SSP adherence processes across our six key markets. In 2018, we

Policy Statement Prohibiting Involuntary Labor*
June 2, 2016
Overview
With 2015 sales of $13.5 billion and more than 1,600 foods, Kellogg is the world's leading cereal company;
second largest producer of cookies, crackers and savory snacks; and a leading North American frozen foods
company. Kellogg Company's more than 1,600 foods are produced in 20 countries on six continents, and
marketed in more than 180 countries.
Our company's vision is nourishing families SO they can flourish and thrive. We do this by fulfilling our purpose,
which is to enrich and delight the world through foods and brands that matter. We know that we can only
achieve our vision and purpose when we take into account the greater impact of our foods all along our supply
chain. We are firmly committed to being a responsible global corporate citizen and recognize our duty to
support, promote and advance human rights within our operations and our supply chain.
Our Policy
Kellogg Company prohibits involuntary labor, including forced, indentured, bonded, slave or human-trafficked
labor (""Involuntary Labor""), within our business operations and our supply chain. Involuntary labor is a
pervasive and insidious global issue that directly and negatively impacts basic human rights. We are committed
to protecting human rights and maintaining an ethical and transparent supply chain, free of Involuntary Labor.
As part of doing so, we have embedded our commitment into our Global Supplier Code of Conduct (""Supplier
Code"") and Global Code of Ethics (""Employee Code"").
Our Supplier Code prohibits suppliers from using or facilitating any type of Involuntary Labor. We
reserve the right to terminate our contract with any supplier, at our sole discretion, for violations of
our Supplier Code. We have provided a Global Supplier Code of Conduct Resource Guide as tool to
help suppliers understand our expectations and approach, providing additional information, helpful
definitions, and links to initiatives and other resources which can support them.
Our Employee Code requires employees to obey the law, act with integrity, show respect and do
business with suppliers that embrace and demonstrate high standards of ethical business behavior. It
requires diligence in determining whether our company and its suppliers conform to our standards;
including prohibiting Involuntary Labor and discrimination. All employees are required to comply with
the Employee Code; failure to do SO can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Our position on human rights is compatible with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
United Nations Guiding Principles, and the core conventions of the International Labour Organization. To
further industry knowledge, collaboration and cooperation, Kellogg is a member of organizations such as AIM-
PROGRESS and the Consumer Goods Forum.
*This policy statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act and the California Transparency in
Supply Chain Act. It constitutes Kellogg Company's anti-slavery and human trafficking statement/disclosure and policy for the financial
year ending December 31, 2015.
Implementation Plan
Kellogg has developed a comprehensive, global corporate responsibility strategy identifying those issues most
relevant to our company and stakeholders. Human rights are one of these issues. We believe it is our duty to
continue educating our internal and external stakeholders on the important issue of Involuntary Labor. We do
SO by raising awareness of, increasing our focus on, and taking accountability for ensuring an ethical and
transparent supply chain, free of Involuntary Labor. (More information on our corporate responsibility strategy
is available in our Corporate Responsibility Report at www.KelloggCompany.com.)
Within our operations we are taking steps to ensure awareness, focus and accountability on this
important issue.
To ensure that our employees are aware of our policies, standards and expectations, we utilize
interactive, immersive online training modules that highlight human rights issues like Involuntary
Labor. We are also currently developing additional training courses on this and other human rights
issues.
To ensure the right focus, a more detailed training and discussion regarding the risks and
implications of Involuntary Labor was presented to our global Procurement leaders and managers
during our 2015 Global Procurement Summit.
To ensure accountability, which is an important aspect of Kellogg Company's culture, our Ethics
Office recently updated our Supplier Code and Employee Code to (among other things) raise
awareness of Involuntary Labor. Our Ethics Office is a resource for clarification of company policy
or for reporting issues related to ethics and compliance matters. Employees and suppliers are
strongly encouraged to contact our Ethics Office to report any actual or suspected violations
without fear of retaliation. For convenience and peace of mind, confidential and anonymous
reporting is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year via telephone and
internet web reporting in over 39 languages.
We use social and ethical compliance assessments of our own facilities to verify that Involuntary
Labor does not exist within our operations.
Within our supply chain, we take a risk-based approach to determine which suppliers need additional
awareness and education, or require verification of adherence to our policies, on this and other
responsible sourcing issues.
All suppliers are required to adhere to our Supplier Code, which is included in all new supplier
contracts and agreement. This is a requirement for supplier selection. By the end of 2014, we
determined that responsible individuals at more than 800 companies representing 85 percent of
our global procurement spend had signed the Supplier Code. Should a critical violation of our
policies, such as incidences of Involuntary Labor, be reported or uncovered, Kellogg has an
escalation procedure in place to ensure rapid response and immediate mitigation and remediation
of the issue.
As part of our commitment to being a responsible global corporate citizen, we proactively share
best practices related to social and ethical issues with our suppliers through events such as our
annual company-sponsored Supplier Day conferences. We are committed to actively engaging
with our suppliers and their value chain network to ensure vigilance and adherence to all company
policies.
*This policy statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act and the California Transparency in
Supply Chain Act. It constitutes Kellogg Company's anti-slavery and human trafficking statement/disclosure and policy for the financial
year ending December 31, 2015.

153,"MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
INTRODUCTION FROM MARTIN SCHOEPPLER, PRESIDENT & CEO OF
FUJIFILM DIMATIX, INC.
FUJIFILM Dimatix, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation and the world’s leading supplier of piezoelectric drop-on-demand inkjet products used for industrial applications, is driving a revolution in inkjet technology to support a new generation of products used for print production, industrial product decoration and materials deposition. The company applies its innovative inkjet technologies and world-class fabrication techniques in the design and manufacture of inkjet printheads, assemblies, components and systems designed to jet a wide range of fluids in precise amounts onto all types of flexible and non-flexible surfaces.
We are a part of the group of companies owned by FUJIFILM Corporation (“FUJIFILM Group”). Our ultimate parent company is FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation. Both FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation and FUJIFILM Corporation have their head offices in Japan.
The FUJIFILM Group is dedicated to developing mutually beneficial partnership relationships with suppliers. Through our procurement policies and procedures the FUJIFILM Group fosters social and environmental responsibility, while encouraging fair trade and free enterprise in international markets.
The FUJIFILM Group is committed to improving our practices to combat any kind of slavery and human trafficking. Companies within the FUJIFILM Group are required to conduct their activities in accordance with the FUJIFILM Group Charter for Corporate Behaviour and the FUJIFILM Group Code of Conduct which cover a variety of ethical business principles including the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in the activities of such companies. As part of the FUJIFILM Group’s commitment to these principles, in June 2015, FUJIFILM Corporation adopted the FUJIFILM Corporate Social Responsibility Procurement Guidelines for suppliers (“Supplier Guidelines”) under which suppliers to FUJIFILM Corporation are requested to commit to ethical business principles in a number of areas where human rights can be affected. These include the prohibition of forced labor, child labor and inhumane treatment. While progress has been made, the Supplier Guidelines are still in the process of being rolled out to FUJIFILM Group companies outside of Asia. However FUJIFILM Corporation has made further progress in its local CSR Procurement activities and its commitment to respect for human rights as evidenced by the following articles: http://www.fujifilmholdings.com/en/sustainability/svp2017/process/policy03/valuechain/01.ht ml http://www.fujifilmholdings.com/en/sustainability/svp2017/process/policy03/cprm/04.html
ORGANISATION STRUCTURE
FUJIFILM Dimatix employs over 650 employees. The company is headquartered in Santa Clara, California and maintains product development and manufacturing facilities in Santa Clara, California, USA and Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.

OUR BUSINESS
FUJIFILM Dimatix, Inc. sells and supports its products worldwide through offices in North America, Europe, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and China. Our customers include OEMs, system integrators and organizations that use the company’s state of the art inkjet products and services in building cutting-edge systems or devising manufacturing processes for application in diverse markets worldwide, including graphics, electronics, flat-panel displays, the life sciences, chemistry, 3-D mechanics, optics, and photovoltaics.
OUR SUPPLY CHAINS
Our supply chains include products and services sourced from both the United States and foreign countries. Current foreign suppliers are located in the following countries: Canada China Finland Taiwan The Netherlands Japan Korea Switzerland United Kingdom Germany Malaysia Sweden
OUR POLICIES ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. We comply with the FUJIFILM Group Charter for Corporate Behaviour and FUJIFILM Group Code of Conduct which reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and promoting this approach in our supply chains.
OUR PROCESSES TO PREVENT SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
All FUJIFILM Group staff around the world are required to abide by the FUJIFILM Group Charter for Corporate Behaviour and FUJIFILM Group Code of Conduct in order to ensure that all FUJIFILM Group companies exhibit and promote ethical business activities. FUJIFILM Group companies are required to complete an annual checklist which requires them to answer questions on their measures to prevent forced and child labor in connection with their compliance with the FUJIFILM Group Charter for Corporate Behaviour and FUJIFILM Group Code of Conduct.
For the products that we sell that are ultimately sourced from FUJIFILM Corporation (if any), FUJIFILM Corporation procurement staff are expected to identify and assess potential risk areas in the supply chain and work with suppliers in those areas in order to seek to establish that those suppliers act in accordance with the Supplier Guidelines.
All material and services purchased from U.S. and foreign suppliers are governed by FUJIFILM Dimatix, Inc.’s Terms and Conditions of Purchase Order. Specifically stated within this document is language that requires the supplier to strictly conform to federal, state and local laws, orders and regulations, including, but not limited to, those regarding occupational safety and health. It is FUJIFILM Dimatix’s firm belief, that slavery and human trafficking would both fall under these terms and conditions of sale.
2

SUPPLIER ADHERENCE TO OUR VALUES AND ETHICS
We promote action to ban slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain.
For the products that we sell that are ultimately sourced from FUJIFILM Corporation (if any), suppliers of those products are requested to commit to the ethical business principles set out in the Supplier Guidelines. Further, FUJIFILM Corporation aims to reflect those standards in cooperation agreements with suppliers and business partners. The Fujifilm Supplier CSR Checklist was being used by the suppliers and business partners responsible for over 70% of the total procurement amount for each business division in Fujifilm Corporation and the FUJIFILM group companies within China by the end of March 2017. During the current financial year FUJIFILM Corporation is following up with suppliers and business partners who have already completed the Checklist to confirm their responses against their actual activities. After this work is completed, FUJIFILM Corporation will expand the use of the Checklist to other suppliers and business partners.
For products that we source ourselves and for services, our activities consist of assessing supplier risk, conducting periodic re-evaluation of supplier risks, and continually monitoring suppliers through such means as on-site audits, business reviews and supplier surveys. Suppliers are evaluated and selected based on their ability to supply components, services or products that meet FUJIFILM Dimatix requirements.
FUJIFILM Dimatix is committed to ethical behavior. The basic values of FUJIFILM Dimatix, Inc. are Integrity, Trust, Credibility, Continuous Improvement and Respect for the Individual. These values are the foundation on which our Company is based, and are the framework on which FUJIFILM Dimatix, Inc. is built.
FUJIFILM Dimatix, Inc. is committed to a work environment in which honesty and integrity prevail at all levels of the Company including the company’s Procurement department. We adhere to our internal Standards of Business Conduct and Compliance with Law Program which outlines the legal and ethical standards each employee has a personal obligation to uphold with each other, customers, vendors and the general public. Employees must operate as good corporate citizens, and comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to their respective businesses, including: requiring those with whom we do business to conduct themselves in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; remaining alert and sensitive to situations that could result in any fraudulent, illegal, unethical, improper actions by any employee, agent or representative; and upholding the principles and practices of equal employment opportunity, non-discrimination and workforce diversity.
As part of the FUJIFILM Group, we also share in the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitment to contribute to the sustainable development of society by putting into practice the FUJIFILM Group's Corporate Philosophy, and realizing its vision through sincere and fair business activities. The CSR Promotion system consists of a committee at the highest level to ensure that the systems are implemented and adhered to. The following systems under the CSR program are used for compliance with supply chain transparency laws and regulations:
 FUJIFILM Group Charter for Corporate Behaviour  FUJIFILM Procurement Policy  FUJIFILM Standards of Business Conduct and Compliance with Law Program (US)

TRAINING To ensure an understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we work with our procurement staff to ensure they act ethically and with integrity in their interactions with our suppliers and to implement and promote this approach in our supply chains. FURTHER STEPS At a FUJIFILM Group level, FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation is now finalizing a Human Rights Policy to strengthen its commitment to important human rights matters such as the elimination of slavery and human trafficking and expects to publish this during the current financial year. In addition it is anticipated that suppliers and business partners to FUJIFILM companies in North America will start utilizing the Supplier Guidelines during the current financial year with those to FUJIFILM’s European companies to follow later in 2018. Following a review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains we intend to take the following further steps to combat slavery and human trafficking: adopt and support all corporate policies related to business ethics and respect for basic human rights, and periodically review our policies and procedures to help maintain compliance with internal policy and external laws. This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the slavery and human trafficking statement for FUJIFILM Dimatix, Inc. for the financial year ending 31 March 2017.

Modern Slavery Act Statement
Our Business
Oak Furniture land is the UKs largest retailer of hardwood furniture with more than 75 stores across the UK. To support our UK operations we have 2 major administrative, warehousing and distributions centres located in Swindon & St Helens.
Supply Chain Overview
We source the majority of our furniture products directly from manufacturers based in Vietnam and China whom we regard as our Tier 1 suppliers. Our Tier 1 suppliers source the timber and raw materials from upstream suppliers based in the USA, China, India & Europe these include forest bureaus, timber processors and leather tanneries whom we consider as Tier 2 & 3 suppliers.
Policy
Oak Furniture Land recognizes the responsibility it has along with its suppliers to operate in an ethical manner. As part of this responsibility, we acknowledge the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and operate a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. We are not willing to tolerate or condone modern day slavery in any part of our operations including our supply chain and will take all appropriate actions to assist the abolition of modern day slavery. We are working to ensure that there is sufficient transparency both within our own organisation and also within our supplier base and have we have developed a series of steps to mitigate the risks of slavery or human trafficking within the business.
Raising awareness & training
In relation to our UK operations we have implemented a code of conduct policy document which applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf, including but not limited to employees at all levels, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners. This includes a confidential whistleblowing service line, continued training where necessary and highlighting the need to be alert to the modern day slavery issues. The code of conduct policy document is attached.
In relation to our overseas suppliers we are in the process of updating the terms and conditions we have with our major suppliers in order to include a reference requiring compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This includes a request that our suppliers comply with our Code of Conduct at all times and themselves operate a workplace that respects workers’ basic human & legal rights.
Through our overseas teams we are working with all our immediate overseas suppliers to ensure they conduct their business with the same commitment to ethical business practices as we do. Our internal Heads of Department have extensive experience of working with factories to assess and improve adherence to quality and ethical standards. They regularly visit our major overseas suppliers and working to improve human rights issues forms part of the factory management role.
Risk assessment & due diligence
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the implementation of this policy however the Chief Financial Officer will be responsible for day to day management. Heads of Departments at all levels are also responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with the the policy and in particular adhere to our no tolerance approach across our whole supply chain.
We recognize that some of the countries in which we either have furniture manufactured or raw materials and timber sourced have medium to high risk of exposure to modern day slavery.
To this end, in 2016 we commenced a journey to map our whole oak timber supply chain from forest to manufacture which includes Tier 2 & 3 Suppliers to enable us to understand and evaluate all aspects of our supply chain. This in addition to our regular visits to our Tier 1 suppliers, many of whom we have long and established relationships with.
Assessment of effectiveness
We also recognise that our commitment to a no-tolerance policy to modern slavery & human rights abuse is a continual journey and therefore

we will continue to assess performance and as with all other areas of our business we will also identify areas in which we need to improve. This policy statement will be reviewed and published annually.

155,"Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy Statement
Introduction from Phil Blakeman, Managing Director
Slavery and human trafficking remains a hidden problem in our global society. We all have a responsibility to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the supply chain. James T Blakeman operates a zero tolerance to child labour, forced labour, harsh or inhumane treatment and any mistreatment of workers in our factories and in our supply chains. All tiers of staff are expected to report concerns and management are expected to act upon them.
Organisation and Structure
James T Blakeman has two factories based on one site in Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire. One is a manufacturing plant and the other is a cooking plant.
Our Supply Chains
Our supply chains include sourcing of raw materials principally related to the manufacture of pork sausages but also other meat products.
Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. This anti-slavery policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
We comply with the standards set down in the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code and have registered with Stronger Together – tackling modern slavery in the supply chains.
Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk:
 Where possible we build long standing relationships with suppliers and make clear our expectations of business behaviour;
 With regard to national or international supply chains, our point of contact is preferably with a UK company or branch and we expect these entities to have suitable anti-slavery and human trafficking policies and procedures. We expect each entity in the supply chain to, as a minimum, adopt a ‘one up’ due diligence on the next link in the chain. It is not practical for us (and every other participant in the chain) to have a direct relationship with all links in the supply chain;
 We have in place systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistle blowers;
 During supplier audits those in our supply chain will be asked for evidence that they are taking steps to prevent slavery and human trafficking.
Supplier Adherence to our Values
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We expect all those in our supply chain and contractors to comply with our values.

The Company Directors are responsible for compliance with this policy.
Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains, we provide information and guidance to relevant members of staff. All Directors and members of the Executive Team have been briefed on the subject.

Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking
We use the following to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:
 Use of labour monitoring and payroll systems to check eligibility of employees in the UK  Audits of recruitment agencies  Audits of our suppliers
This statement is made in pursuant to section 51(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2016 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the current financial year.

158,"Nikon Corporation Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the fiscal year ended March 2016
This statement is made pursuant to the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act of 2015. Nikon Corporation endeavours to ensure that there are no human rights violations related to our own operations, our supply chain and our products. We hereby provide disclosure concerning our activities to prevent and tackle slavery and human trafficking.
a. Overview of the company, business and supply chain Details of our company and business information can be found on the following website:
URL：http://www.nikon.com/about/info/index.htm Most of our products sold in the U.K. market are through our group companies. However, some of our products are sold directly from Nikon Corporation to the U.K. market. Product parts and a small portion of the final products are supplied from external procurement partners in and outside of Japan. There are approximately 1,700 procurement partners as of March 2016. More than ninety percent of the procurement partners are based in Japan, China and Thailand (calculated by the number of companies and in which country their headquarters are located).
b. Policies related to modern slavery and human trafficking We have established “Nikon Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Charter” which addresses our group’s basic stance on our social responsibility, including ‘Respect for human beings’ and ‘Socially responsible behaviour within the supply chain’. We demonstrate our commitment to respect human rights in our business as well as in our supply chain. To enable every single employee to apply this Charter in daily activities, we outline the standards of how we act ethically, with integrity and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations in the Nikon Code of Conduct. In the Code, we state that we do not tolerate forced or child labour and we request our procurement partners to comply with our standards.
The Nikon CSR Charter can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.16): http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=17 The Nikon Code of Conduct can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.47): http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=48
As for our supply chain, we published in August 2015 “Nikon CSR Procurement Standards”, which is the guideline to promote Nikon’s stance on CSR throughout our supply chain and we request our procurement partners to comply with it. The Standards are based on the EICC (Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition) Code of Conduct, which is the global standard for the electronics industry and articulates the prohibition of “forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labour, involuntary prison labour, modern slavery or trafficking of persons”.
The Nikon CSR Procurement Standards can be found on the following website: URL：http://www.nikon.com/about/info/procurement/csr.htm
In response to the issues of conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighboring countries, we set a policy of not using conflict minerals mined or intermediated by armed forces violating human rights in the area, and have been conducting surveys in our supply chain specifically on this issue.
Nikon’s Policy on Conflict Minerals can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.106): http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=107

We also support the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact which can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.29): http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=30
Nikon group’s CSR promotion organigram (as well as the CSR promotion organigram regarding procurement partners) can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.62): http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=63
c. Due diligence Potential risk of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring is considered higher in our supply chain than in our group companies. In Nikon group companies, we conduct human rights & labour monitoring annually to ensure child and forced labour practices are not occurring. We will evaluate and address risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain by enforcing the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards with our procurement partners and by conducting periodic monitoring.
In light of conflict mineral issues, we endeavour to prevent human rights violations such as modern slavery and human trafficking from occurring by ensuring that conflict minerals are not used in our products following our Policy on Conflict Minerals and by conducting investigations of our product components.
More details can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.105): http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=106
Establishment of Hotlines For Nikon employees, we have hotline(s) per company (or per region) for them to be able to report and/consult. As for our supply chain, Nikon CSR Procurement Standards state “Our Procurement Partners should have a communicated process for their personnel to be able to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation.” We will urge our procurement partners to set up such a mechanism through our monitoring activities to check the compliance status of the Standards.
We established a Conflict Minerals Hotline in October 2015 in order to get reports from our stakeholders, if there are acts contrary to the Nikon Policy on Conflict Minerals, or if it is a concern. We investigate properly the information obtained through the Hotline and take corrective actions as necessary.

Risk assessment and risk management In the fiscal year ended March 2016, we defined our business partner risk assessment criteria such as location, business type, transaction volume, length of business partnership and type of contract. Based on the assessment results, we conducted a self-assessment survey among 207 major 1st-tier business partners to check the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards compliance status. We received a response from all the surveyed companies. The answers to each question were weighed according to potential risks and we created risk profiles after compiling all the response data.
e. Measurement by appropriate indicators and effectiveness From the above mentioned risk assessment results, we identified three potentially high risk companies and conducted on-site audits in these companies using third party auditors after advance notification. These companies are all located in Asian countries. The results of the audits conducted
2

in February and March 2016 identified some concerns in the area of labour and ethics in these companies and we requested rectification. Ten other companies where we did not conduct audits but which had been identified as relatively high risk were instructed to make improvements in the areas where the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards were not satisfied. We demanded that all 13 companies submit action plans and implement them after our approval. We are monitoring the implementation and they are progressing according to the plans. Overall in the fiscal year ended March 2016, we did not find any modern slavery and/or human trafficking issues.
The status and progress of the surveys, audits and improvement action plans are all reported to the Nikon Corporation CSR Committee which includes Board members via the Supply Chain SubCommittee. The Supply Chain Sub-Committee is chaired by Corporate Vice President in charge of supply chain management, and its members include quality assurance and procurement department heads from each business unit.
More details about our activities based on the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.103): http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=104
We shall continue to disclose the details of our activity in relation to the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards such as the number of companies conducting self-assessment and audits as progress indicators.
f. Training and Capacity building We explained modern slavery and human trafficking to the Supply Chain Sub-Committee when Nikon CSR Procurement Standards were deliberated and approved.
In the fiscal year ending March 2016, we held internal briefing sessions for 160 personnel who are responsible for product-related procurement in each business unit in Japan, China and Thailand. They were trained on the contents of the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards and requested to comply with them. We also provided two basic training sessions on procurement to 60 other personnel who have purchasing activities in other functions, explaining Nikon’s stance on CSR and the CSR Procurement Standards. In the next fiscal year, we will review the training contents to enhance understanding of slavery and human trafficking risk.
As for our procurement partners, we held explanatory sessions on CSR Procurement Standards and conflict minerals. Representing 897 1st-tier procurement partner companies, 1,223 people attended the training sessions in Japan, China and Thailand. In the next fiscal year, we will endeavour to improve the contents of the training aiming to deepen their understanding of modern slavery and the human trafficking risk.
More details concerning training can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.103): http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=104

162,"MODERN SLAVERY ACT TRANSPARENCY STATEMENT
As a leader in foodservice distribution, Sysco recognizes and takes seriously its responsibility to follow industry best practices and distribute food products from suppliers that meet high standards of safety, quality, traceability and social and environmental stewardship. Sysco expects its suppliers to uphold the rights of individuals as outlined in the United Nation Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR), the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Any act of human trafficking, slavery or child labor within Sysco’s supply chain is unacceptable and is specifically prohibited by the Code (as defined below).
Sysco maintains a strict Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code”) containing the legal, moral and ethical standards it expects of suppliers, including the protection of human rights. Sysco requires each of its suppliers and their facilities to operate in full compliance with the Code and with all applicable national, state, provincial, regional, local and other laws and regulations. The Code also applies to affiliates and subcontractors of suppliers and to their respective facilities to the extent those facilities supply goods for ultimate sale to Sysco. Specifically, the Code states that Sysco will only initiate and renew contractual relationships with suppliers that do not violate basic human rights. Sysco is currently working to benchmark the Code against its peers as well as best practices to identify opportunities to strengthen the requirements placed on its suppliers.
In addition, all Sysco Brand approved seafood suppliers in high-risk Latin American and Asian countries must undergo third party assessments to identify potential risks relating to wages, working hours, discrimination, worker safety, living conditions, and child and forced labor. Global independent safety science leader UL’s Responsible Sourcing Group has conducted these annual audits on Sysco’s behalf since 2008. Based on the results of these audits, Sysco works with its Sysco Brand suppliers and processors that do not achieve perfect scores to develop improvement plans and then conduct follow-up assessments to ensure that plans have been implemented. In the event that a supplier or processor is unable or unwilling to introduce improvements, or if a supplier or processor has committed a critical violation of its standards, Sysco terminates the relationship. Sysco is currently exploring enhancements to this longstanding supplier audit program, including consideration of an updated, more dynamic risk assessment tool.
As a result of specific concerns about labor violations in the seafood supply chain that have recently been chronicled in the media, Sysco has increased its efforts on several fronts, both independently as well as in cooperation with other companies, associations and NGOs.
As a member of the National Fisheries Institute (NFI), which has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the leading global social responsibility standards to help participating companies find the most thorough and credible labor systems, Sysco is committed to conducting business with entities that follow international laws to ensure an appropriate, safe, ethical and sustainable food supply chain. Through its membership in NFI, Sysco actively participates with other stakeholders to support

actions needed to end human rights violations, including a call for governments in Southeast Asia and throughout the world to be more vigilant in enforcing fair, moral and ethical labor practices.
Sysco has also recently joined the Shrimp Sustainable Supply Chain Task Force, a membership organization that includes retail, foodservice and NGO participation. The task force aims to strengthen worker well-being and compliance with laws governing the seafood supply chain through implementation of a track and trace system of international verification from vessel to feed mill; development of a standard code of conduct model for ports, brokers and vessels; and support for fishery improvement projects to mitigate the effects of overfishing, which can contribute to human rights abuses in the shrimp supply chain.
Earlier this year, Sysco reinforced its commitment to improving the sustainability of seafood procurement practices and standards by extending its longstanding alliance with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) through 2020. Among other things, Sysco is working with WWF to enhance seafood traceability within its supply chain and globally by participating in the Global Dialogue for Seafood Traceability.
Sysco has also undertaken a number of additional actions specific to suppliers and processors in Southeast Asia. Sysco suspended all purchases of unprocessed, farm-raised shrimp from Thailand under the Sysco Portico Brand since October 2014. Sysco has also maintained regular communication with all of its seafood suppliers regarding these issues, including dialogue with suppliers in Thailand about actions they are taking to eradicate human rights issues in the supply chain. Sysco continues to monitor actions by processors in Thailand on an ongoing basis to evaluate their progress and proactively look for proof that they remain active participants in efforts to protect human rights. Sysco believes ongoing engagement and monitoring of suppliers is necessary to drive continuous improvement. By continuing to participate in the international seafood market, Sysco believes it can contribute to the type of successful reforms that have taken place in landbased industries with simpler supply chains like textiles, technology and other food products.
Beyond the numerous steps taken to date, Sysco will continue to consider further actions to evaluate and strengthen current practices as well as opportunities to collaborate with other stakeholders to ensure that its seafood supply chain is free from any human rights concerns. Sysco is committed to playing a constructive role in addressing this serious issue and will engage with interested stakeholders to develop and implement meaningful, practical and effective solutions.
This statement has been published in accordance with section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. This statement applies to the fiscal year ending July 2, 2016.
This statement has been approved by the Corporate Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors of Sysco Corporation.

Infinera’s Disclosure
Infinera strives to maintain a culture of compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and adhere to the highest standards of ethics and business conduct with respect to human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain. Infinera expects its suppliers to conduct their business in a lawful manner, but also in compliance with the same high standards of integrity and ethics. Infinera’s relationship with its contract manufacturers (CMs) and suppliers is governed by Infinera’s Supplier Code of Conduct.
Verification – Infinera surveys its top suppliers and conducts on-site audits of its major CMs and suppliers to assess and evaluate their performance on topics including labor conditions, child labor and human trafficking. Infinera considers these principles in the selection of its CMs and suppliers with the intention to actively monitor their compliance though currently no third party audit or verification system is in place.
Audit – Supplier audits are announced and conducted by Infinera using audit protocols designed to assess supplier performance relative to the Responsible Business Alliance and the Infinera Supplier Code of Conduct, all of which address issues of human trafficking and slavery. Infinera believes that workers at supplier facilities have the right to freely choose employment, the right to free association, and the right of the workplace to be free of harassment and unlawful discrimination.

Internal Accountability – Infinera requires all employees and management, including those who are directly responsible for supply chain management, to complete training of Infinera’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which includes compliance with all applicable laws. Non-compliance with Infinera’s standards may result in corrective action or termination. There is also whistleblowing procedure, which allows an employee to raise a concern without fear of retaliation, as well as an Anti-Bribery Policy.
Training – Infinera employees with direct responsibility for supply chain management receive training on all company policies, practices and procedures designed to ensure that Infinera’s supply chain is free of human trafficking and slavery, including general risk mitigation.

If we learn of any allegations of human trafficking or slavery through our whistleblowing system, our supplier audits or any other means, we will act promptly and effectively in the best interests of the workers affected, which could mean the termination of the business relationship with the CM, supplier or contractor concerned. This statement constitutes Infinera’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended December 30, 2017. James L.

The following statement has been prepared in the fulfilment of adidas (UK) Limited’s obligations (including Reebok UK’s obligations, a trading division of adidas (UK) Limited) under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our company’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2017. The Modern Slavery Act seeks to address the role of businesses in preventing slavery and human trafficking from occurring in their business and supply chains and adidas is proud of the steps we have taken to combat slavery and human trafficking described in this statement and supporting documents. We are committed to improving our practices to ensure that our preventive and remedial efforts continue to be relevant, timely and effective.
adidas (UK) Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of adidas AG, which is a publicly-listed company on the German stock exchange. adidas’ products, which are distributed and sold to consumers in the United Kingdom, are manufactured in a variety of countries from around the world.

For more information on our supply chain structure and to view our global supplier lists please see: adidas-group.com/s/human-rights
We are well aware of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in global supply chains and have been actively monitoring and assessing the potential for adverse human rights impacts of human trafficking, forced labour and bonded labour for many years. We have clear and well-defined policies on human trafficking and slavery, and well-established due diligence processes for our own business and our supply chain, as well as a dedicated monitoring team within the company’s Legal & Compliance Division which is responsible for external training and inspection.

These are the main performance criteria against which we measure our business progress. We also measure our suppliers through an annual social compliance Key Performance Indicator. The indicator evaluates a supplier’s compliance with our Workplace Standards, which include a prohibition against the use of any form of forced labour, child labour or human trafficking.
We have zero tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure all those in our supply chain and our contractors comply with our values, each year we conduct country level risk appraisals that define the scope of our human rights due diligence activities, including identification of high risk issues such as human trafficking, forced labour and child labour and we actively engage in preventing, mitigating and, when necessary, remediating issues that are linked to modern slavery and human trafficking.

We have carried out a review of our direct supply chain and have concluded that the risks of modern slavery and human traﬃcking are low. However, we acknowledge that we must remain vigilant to the risks and ensure that our vendors

understand and play their part in ensuring that modern slavery and human traﬃcking does not take place in our organisa on or supply chains. This message is reiterated to our suppliers via our procurement teams in each supplier quarterly review.

3. Relevant policies and contracts
To reinforce our commitment to comba ng slavery and traﬃcking, we have implemented the following policies, which set out our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, both within our own opera ons and our supply chain:
(a) We have in place a Responsible Sourcing Policy which applies to all our opera ons and those in our supply chain. This Policy makes speciﬁc reference to our zero-tolerance stance on modern slavery.
(b) We have reviewed the steps we take when engaging with new vendors, contractors and business partners to ensure that they are aware of and will adhere to our Responsible Sourcing Policy and to assess the likelihood of slavery or traﬃcking exis ng in those organisa ons and what measures are already in place to combat those risks.
(c) We have published guidance to our employees through our internal An -Slavery Policy, which applies to all those working for us or on our behalf (and which includes contractors and agency workers).
(d) We have reviewed the steps we take when engaging with new vendors, contractors and business partners to ensure that they are aware of and will adhere to our Responsible Sourcing Policy and to assess the likelihood of slavery or traﬃcking exis ng in those organisa ons and what measures are already in place to combat those risks.
(e) We have reviewed our exis ng policies and have made amendments to recognise our obliga ons under the Act including our Whistleblowing Policy.
(f) Our ul mate parent company has also launched our global Code of Conduct policy and which ﬁts with our principles and values here at Weetabix. This Code provides support to our employees in making day to day ethical decisions in addi on to the policies already in place.
4. Risk assessment processes
We have considered the risk of modern slavery in our own opera ons and we have concluded that, on the basis that we are a UK employer subject to UK employment protec ons and prac ces and already have well developed checks and balances within our business, we have a low risk of modern slavery occurring in our own opera ons.
Our suppliers which fall into the following categories are strongly encouraged to commit and adhere to the Weetabix Standards, which include a requirement to abide by the Ethical Trading Ini a ve base code and to be a member of Sedex:-
• Suppliers of Ingredients to Weetabix.
• Suppliers of Packaging Materials to Weetabix.
• Those involved in the co-manufacturing, co-packing and licensed manufacture of Weetabix Brands.
We have considered the risk of modern slavery occurring in our use of external labour via employment agencies and our direct suppliers. Given the organisa ons that we work with and the exis ng checks and balances that we apply in these areas, we have concluded that the risks of modern slavery are low in this area.
We have concluded that we would beneﬁt from a higher degree of oversight in rela on to our direct suppliers where the

modern slavery risk is deemed higher and this is an area of focus that we have iden ﬁed going forward into our next ﬁnancial year.
5. Due diligence processes In order to prevent slavery and traﬃcking in our business and supply chains, we are taking steps to update and improve our supplier due diligence process, par cularly in the case of our direct suppliers and any supplier not subject to the Weetabix Standards. This includes integra ng and ac ng upon the ﬁndings of our risk assessment processes described above and taking ac on to embed zero tolerance of modern slavery and traﬃcking. We are taking the following steps in rela on to our supply chain:-
• Amending the “Weetabix Standards” to make speciﬁc reference to our zero-tolerance stance on modern slavery. • Reviewing those in our supply chain not subject to the Weetabix Standards, with a view to engaging with those
suppliers where modern slavery risks are deemed higher, in order to: • set out our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery; • require them to conﬁrm that they will adhere to the principles set out in our Responsible Sourcing Policy;
We review the responses from our suppliers to judge future ac ons and assess what further due diligence or other steps are required.
6. Training To raise awareness of slavery and traﬃcking, and of our policies and procedures, we have developed an induc on and con nuous learning approach to training employees in this area using our compliance calendar. All compliance modules must be completed by each employee on an annual basis. We have dedicated compliance modules covering key compliance areas, including An -slavery, An -bribery, Ethics and Code of Conduct which are compulsory courses for all staﬀ.
7. Measuring eﬀec veness – performance indicators In order to monitor the eﬀec veness of the steps we have taken to stop slavery and traﬃcking taking place in our business and supply chains, we will use the following performance indicators for the ﬁnancial year ahead:
• All employees will have completed the relevant training, as referenced above. • We have issued our An -Slavery and Human Traﬃcking Policy to our workforce through our compliance calendar
communica on se ng out our stance in rela on to modern slavery. • We will establish a process to gain a be er oversight of our direct supply chain and consider how best to risk assess,
carry out due diligence and communicate with these suppliers in rela on to MSA issues. We will consider whether it is appropriate to raise speciﬁc ques ons in rela on to slavery and traﬃcking with these suppliers. • We will ensure that we con nue to refresh and revise our An -Slavery and Human Traﬃcking clauses in our contracts with our suppliers. • As a minimum (and focusing ini ally on those suppliers we deem to be higher risk), we will send out to those suppliers

not subject to the Weetabix Standards, correspondence: • se ng out our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery; • require them to conﬁrm that they will adhere to the principles set out in our Responsible Sourcing Policy.
• As we develop our risk assessment and due diligence processes, we will assess and consider the appropriateness of developing further measures, where we assess that there may be a heightened risk of slavery and traﬃcking within those organisa ons. We will take appropriate measures to encourage and persuade them to adopt their own measures to minimise the risks of slavery and traﬃcking within their own organisa ons and the supply chain beyond.
As referenced in this statement, we will monitor the need for further ac on to be taken and other key performance indicators to be implemented as we con nue our risk assessment and due diligence ac vi es and get responses from our key suppliers. This statement has been approved by the Weetabix board of directors who will review and update it annually. Signed on behalf of the Board of Directors by Sally Abbo January 2019

168,"Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Caterpillar Inc., including its majority owned subsidiaries, and joint ventures and following a transition period, newly acquired companies (“Caterpillar”), is committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights throughout its global operations, as noted in our Human Rights Policy and our Supplier Code of Conduct, both of which are publicly available. Caterpillar’s Human Rights Policy, which was developed taking into consideration principles in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, applies to the entire Caterpillar enterprise.
Suppliers are an essential part of Caterpillar’s extended value chain and Caterpillar is committed to working with them to uphold the principles in our Values in Action, Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy. We have implemented a number of actions to safeguard against slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain and support the objectives of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and Section 54 of United Kingdom’s Modern Slavery Act of 2015:
Verification
Caterpillar requires a selection of our suppliers to complete a self-assessment, requesting information on a number of issues set out in our Supplier Code of Conduct, including human rights, such as policies and procedures they have in place to tackle slavery and human trafficking in their own supply chain. The selfassessment is administered by a third party and addresses issues and questions determined by Caterpillar. In addition, we assess, through a third party, potential human rights impacts across a selection of suppliers, including the impacts to rights-holders from forced labor, slavery and human trafficking.
Supplier Audits and Certification
Caterpillar reserves the right to verify our supplier’s compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct. However, we do not currently perform audits or require that our suppliers certify that materials incorporated into products comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which they are doing business.
In the event that Caterpillar becomes aware of any actions or conditions not in compliance with Caterpillar’s Supplier Code of Conduct, Caterpillar reserves the right to demand corrective measures.
Internal Accountability
Our standard purchase order terms and conditions require that suppliers comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, including an expectation that our suppliers conduct all business in a manner that respects human rights. Our employees are expected to observe our Values in Action and respect the human rights and dignity of all people. However, Caterpillar does not currently maintain internal procedures for employees regarding slavery and human trafficking specifically.
We encourage our employees, suppliers and other stakeholders to report any human rights concerns or grievances to Caterpillar’s Office of Business Practices through the following avenues:
• Toll-free Helpline (U.S., Canada and U.S. Virgin Islands): 1-800-300-7898 • Email: BusinessPractices@cat.com

• International Toll-free Helpline numbers: www.caterpillar.com/en/company/code-ofconduct/office-of-business-practices.html
• Caterpillar’s Global Human Rights Manager can also be contacted directly at Human.Rights@cat.com
All reported incidents are managed though a formal process to understand and address the issue, as appropriate. In the event that Caterpillar becomes aware of any actions regarding a supplier not in compliance with Caterpillar’s Supplier Code of Conduct, Caterpillar reserves the right to demand corrective measures.
Training
As part of our enterprise human rights program, we have conducted human rights training for key human resources employees, country managers, all licensee product managers and the more than 200 external licensees, the compliance council, our dealer district managers, various executive leadership teams, the direct marketing group, the global security team, the mergers and acquisitions team, the product source planning group, the sustainability group and certain employees with responsibility for supply network relationships. Through our training, we promote a culture of ongoing awareness by helping our sourcing managers to identify potential human rights violations at our suppliers’ facilities. We expect to provide human rights training to all other employees no later than December 31, 2017.

169,"Modern Slavery and Transparency in Supply Chains
Statement

Purpose and scope

Who we are

This Modern Slavery and Transparency in Supply Chains Statement (“Statement”) is made in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”). The Statement relates to the activities of Simplyhealth Group Limited and its subsidiary companies.

Simplyhealth exists to improve access to healthcare. We make accessing healthcare easier for millions of people in a sustainable way that delivers long term impact.
What we do

This Statement sets out the steps we continue to take to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains. Although the proposed Modern Slavery (Transparency in Supply Chains) Bill is no longer proceeding, we have adopted its enhanced transparency provisions; our approach aligns with the aims of the independent review of the Act launched by the Home Office in July this year.
Our approach
We tackle modern slavery and human trafficking by educating and informing our employees, making clear commitments and progressing against those commitments and owning the challenges faced. This Statement is once again written in the spirit of transparency; it acknowledges that while we have progressed we are committed to improving our practices and there are still areas on which we need to work.

We do this by funding healthcare interventions directly (through our charitable partners and giving), by influencing (working with public authorities, local and national government) and through insurancebased health plans that help people access and get funding for healthcare.
Our plans cover areas including but not limited to; dental, optical, musculoskeletal, counselling and some overall health assessments, as well as plans that cover pet health. We provide direct to the consumer, via corporate employee benefit schemes, or by health practitioners themselves.

Supply chains
Simplyhealth always attempts to source goods and services from suppliers on our Approved Supplier List (“ASL”). Suppliers are added to the ASL following appropriate and defined due diligence and contractual checks. By way of a checklist within our control framework, we can evidence that appropriate programmes are in place to manage the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking; this requirement extends to ensuring that our suppliers have similarly appropriate arrangements.
We believe that effective procurement at Simplyhealth includes ethical, socially responsible behaviours in all supplier interactions including:
• Engagement and compliance with the Bribery Act 2010;
• Engagement and compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015;
• Engagement and compliance with outsourcing regulatory requirements; and
• Avoidance (or declaration) of any conflict of interest.

Training, Guidance and Principles relating to Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
• All employees within our procurement function have a full understanding of the issues affecting us in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking.
• Our legal function has a full understanding of the impact of modern slavery and human trafficking, together with the need for our business to implement the provisions of the Act with a purposive approach, not merely at a compliance level.
• We believe that our strength is in our people and their vigilance will ensure successful engagement. As such all employees have access to our modern slavery and human trafficking documentation via our corporate intranet. We have provided guidance to our employees regarding our corporate duties and our expectations in relation to employee action and awareness. The guidance includes links to the Modern Slavery Helpline website, the government modern slavery website and this statement; together with information regarding internal communication and reporting.
• Simplyhealth has produced a modern slavery and human trafficking policy which is available to all staff and clarifies our zero tolerance approach in a clear, short form document.
• Our Board of Directors has been made aware and fully briefed on the nature and requirements of the Act, and the impact on our group.

The following supplementary principles and toolkits are available to all employees:
• Running our Business – we have an updated Whistleblowing Policy in place to allow all employees to be able to report any concerns about how their colleagues are treated, or to report any concern regarding our business practices. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of modern slavery or human trafficking. The whistleblowing toolkit is designed to make it easy for employees to make disclosures without fear of retaliation;
• Our People - we strive for the highest possible standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour as laid out in Our People Principles;
• Agency Workers – we use only specified, reputable employment agencies to source labour and we always verify the practices of any new agency we are using before accepting workers from that agency; and
• Our approach to corporate social responsibility underpins how the organisation takes account of the economic, social and environmental impact of our operation.

Process Owners
We have maintained our internal governance structure at both operational and leadership levels. The General Counsel, together with the senior management of each business unit (in conjunction with our procurement function) remain responsible for engagement.
Assessment of risk
We have conducted a risk assessment of modern slavery and human trafficking in relation to our procurement process, supply chains and internal workings.
Simplyhealth is not heavily reliant on third party suppliers. Our business has developed since publication of our previous Statement, with Simplyhealth moving its focus away from direct product retail. This decreased reliance on external manufacturers has reduced our overall risk.
We do however continue to rely on IT as well as some outsourced services. We are aware that there are modern slavery and human trafficking risks in these supply chains. Wherever possible we attempt to purchase these goods and services from large, global suppliers.

Going forward we are proposing to implement a checklist within our procurement records, to ensure each internal buyer has undertaken due diligence on a new supplier. We accept we have limited ability to influence how our suppliers structure their supply chains. It is hoped however that by compliance with, and promotion of, the Act we will play our part in influencing all suppliers in the way they manage their supply chains.
We are yet to undertake a risk assessment of worldwide services used by our customers. We hope to do this in the near future, with particular reference to the provision of treatment provided by partners providing worldwide dental injury and dental emergency cover.

Evaluation
To evaluate the effectiveness of the measures we are taking, our process owners will be responsible for modern slavery and human trafficking engagement, and publicising this across the group.
We have maintained a framework for organisational accountability, to allow for employees and others to raise issues, make suggestions, voice grievances and report suspected or actual modern slavery or human trafficking.
We have raised awareness amongst our people, of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking, the requirements of the Act and its objectives, together with our procedures to ensure compliance.
We aim to map our supply chains for goods assessed as potentially higher risk, with reference to the Global Slavery Index.

Introduction

At Mars, we believe everyone touched by our business should be treated with fairness, dignity and respect.

We are a global, principles-driven company seeking to promote and advance respect for human rights across our value chain - from farms to our suppliers’ factories to our own workplaces. For more than 100 years, we’ve sought to bring our FIVE PRINCIPLES of Quality, Responsibility, Mutuality, Efficiency and Freedom to life every day, in pursuit of creating shared growth and opportunity across the communities we touch.
Forced labor is defined in the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Forced Labour Convention of 1930 as “all work which is extracted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.”

The ILO indicates that most situations of modern slavery and human trafficking are included in their definition of forced labor. 1 As a company committed to human rights good practice, we have prioritized action on this serious topic. We believe that forced labor in any of its forms has no place in our operations or supply chains and that business, government and civil society must work together to make progress on this complex issue. This disclosure details our efforts to address forced labor, including modern slavery and human trafficking, which are core components of our global human rights strategy and programs.

Policies &
Governance
Advancing respect for human rights is a cross-functional responsibility embedded throughout our global business.
A dedicated global human rights team works with colleagues across our business as our policies are applied. Our Human Rights Working Group meets monthly and brings together day-to-day practitioners from relevant business segments and functions to discuss and advance human rights priorities. Our Human Rights Steering Committee, comprised of senior executives in Corporate Affairs, Legal, Human Resources, Operations and Commercial, meets quarterly to review our global human rights progress, issues and performance. Our Board of Directors and our global management team review an annual report on our human rights progress and challenges. This governance structure supports proactive understanding of our human rights strategies and plans.
Our policies include a focus on the elimination of forced labor as a critical component of our overall human rights approach.
Our Human Rights Policy is informed by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. It outlines our commitment to respecting human rights in our own operations and to advancing respect for human rights in our extended supply chains.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct is also informed by international human rights standards and best practices. It describes the human rights standards we expect our first-tier suppliers to uphold, covering forced labor, including modern slavery. The Code prohibits the use of prison, slave, bonded, forced and indentured labor and human trafficking.

Our Human Rights
Approach

FOCUS AREAS
Through continuous consultations across our business, review with leading human rights experts and analysis of publicly available risk information, we have identified forced labor and child labor as the human rights issues that may pose the most severe risk to people in our supply chains. Even as we work to advance respect for all rights, we place special emphasis on these salient issues and we prioritize actions that reach the most vulnerable people.
DUE DILIGENCE & UNDERSTANDING RISK
A foundational step in our human rights due diligence approach is supply chain mapping and traceability analysis, which provides us with essential information on the nature and extent of our extended supply chains. As we increase our understanding and level of traceability, we work with partners such as Verisk Maplecroft to better understand human rights risk at the country level. We use publically available data from sources such as the U.S. Department of Labor, media and civil society reports, and proprietary analysis provided by Verisk Maplecroft’s team of human rights risk analytics experts. This includes the identification of unique regional risks, such as the significant migrant labor workforce in the Middle East. This analysis drives the creation of human rights risk scorecards that inform the development of our human rights action plans.
Based on the specific risks identified, our global human rights team advises and supports colleagues across the business on the use of additional due diligence tools. This work, often implemented with independent human rights experts, may include tools such as further desk research, selfassessment questionnaires, audits and rapid human rights risk assessments.

Modern Slavery Statement 2016

Our Human Rights
Approach

CARE FRAMEWORK
Drawing on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we have developed an action-oriented framework to guide human rights decisions and actions across our business. This CARE Framework informs our strategy and planning development through four key phases – Commit, Assess, Respond, Engage. We use this framework to develop Human Rights Action Plans for priority raw material supply chains. We have developed a Practitioners’ Guide to the CARE Framework and we train relevant internal teams in applying the framework, which includes the following steps.

Commit: Forming a cross-functional team across all relevant functions (often including Commercial, Corporate Affairs and Legal) with clear accountabilities and governance processes. Identifying or creating relevant policies, standards and practices. Allocating appropriate resources to support successful activation of the agreed plan.
Assess: Conducting human rights due diligence in order to understand relevant human rights impacts including, where possible, input from impacted and vulnerable people and local communities.
Respond: Seeking to prevent, address and remediate human rights impacts, either directly or in close collaboration with industry, government and civil society. Such actions may include monitoring and verification systems, awareness raising and training or grievance mechanisms, remediation of individual cases, and addressing the enabling environment and root causes.
Engage: Engaging externally to learn from and collaborate with others and to share our own progress and challenges transparently. Seeking to mobilize or join key coalitions and to drive collective action across sectors to meet shared goals.

Mars Human Rights
Strategy

Our human rights strategy is focused on deploying programs in three areas – our own operations, with our first-tier suppliers and in our extended supply chains. We are beginning to develop customized training and tools across our programs, including a focus on forced labor.

RESPONSIBLE WORKPLACE
Mars has always prioritized creating and maintaining great workplaces where our Associates can thrive. Our Responsible Workplace program aims to ensure that the human rights of all workers in our workplaces are respected and that we are engaged with the communities in which we operate.
We also seek to ensure that all Associates in Mars workplaces are aware of and have access to our accredited Ombudsman program through which they can confidentially and anonymously report any workplace issue. To validate our approach, we engage independent auditors with expertise in labor issues to assess our human rights performance in our workplaces. Any non-compliances that are identified are addressed. Our Responsible Workplace Site Implementation Guide details our human rights standards and expectations for our own workplaces, including prohibition of forced labor.

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
Our goal is to work with partners who share our principles-based approach to business. We expect our first-tier suppliers to respect human rights in their workplaces. In 2011 we developed our Supplier Code of Conduct, which describes our human rights expectations of all first-tier suppliers and prohibits forced labor, and we initiated our Responsible Sourcing program.
We expect our suppliers to align with our Code, affirming their commitment to uphold it or demonstrating an equivalent policy of their own. As part of our commitment to building supplier capability, we periodically engage suppliers in human rights dialogue, awareness raising and training to drive continuous improvements.
In addition, select suppliers are required to conduct independent workplace assessments based on a range of factors including whether they are operating in a high human rights risk geography. Audited suppliers are required to implement corrective actions and are re-assessed to measure compliance. The human rights issues most commonly identified in these assessments relate to health and safety and work hours. As of year-end 2016, more than 85% of our first-tier suppliers had met the requirements of our program. All of our Commercial Associates are expected to take our Responsible Sourcing training course – content includes our human rights standards and expectations of our suppliers, including with regard to forced labor.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUSTAINABLE SOURCING
At Mars, our sustainable sourcing efforts focus on addressing five sustainability impacts - greenhouse gas, water, land, human rights and income. This includes working to establish traceability of our supply chains and developing and implementing strategies to drive improvements across supply chains.
We focus on advancing respect for human rights in our extended supply chains. We do so in close collaboration with our suppliers, their business partners, the industry, government and communities. We prioritize work on supply chains in which the most severe human rights risks, including forced labor, may be present, including, for example, cocoa, fish and palm oil. Our Practitioner’s Guide to Human Rights in Sustainable Sourcing contains detailed guidance on activating our CARE Framework and developing human rights action plans, including elements related to forced labor. Tailored training is provided to relevant teams internally.

Strategy in Action

COCOA

The following are examples of our human rights approach in extended supply chains in which human rights challenges are systemic.

COCOA
In cocoa communities in West Africa, we are working to increase farmer incomes through productivity gains, investing in women’s economic empowerment, and partnering with our suppliers and other stakeholders to put in place emerging bestpractice human rights monitoring and remediation systems related to child labor and forced labor.
Through our collaborations with the International Labour Organization and the International Cocoa Initiative, and through our leadership role in the World Cocoa Foundation, we are seeking to drive impact and industry action. Additional details about our approach are available here.

FISH
In 2016, we launched a Thai Fish Supply Chain Human Rights Action Plan which includes key performance indicators and which utilizes the CARE Framework.
As part of our longstanding commitment to sustainably sourced fish, we have mapped our fish supply chain in Southeast Asia, we are working with experts to identify any potential human rights issues through to the vessel level, and we are committed to working with our supply chain partners and others to address issues that are identified. We are working with a range of partners including the Issara Institute, a local NGO with unique networks among vulnerable migrant workers in the Thai fish industry, in efforts to assess and improve conditions for workers.

PALM OIL
Since 2013, we have purchased 100% certified palm oil and we support efforts to increase the human rights focus of multi-stakeholder initiatives such as the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil. We are working to go beyond certification as we seek to ensure that the palm oil we use is produced with respect for human rights. We expect our suppliers to meet our palm oil standards and to engage with their suppliers to advance respect for human rights in their extended supply chains, with a particular focus on risks facing vulnerable migrant workers.
We partner with The Forest Trust to support this work as part of our ongoing effort to identify issues, build capabilities and improve practices in our supply chain and at the industry level.

Stakeholder
Engagement

A key component of our approach to human rights is engaging with credible third party experts and stakeholders, deepening our awareness and understanding of these complex issues and identifying partners to drive action. Our efforts include engaging workers and community members. The following are examples of our stakeholder engagement with a focus on forced labor.

THE CONSUMER GOODS FORUM
We are taking action in our business and supply chains to advance The Consumer Goods Forum’s (CGF) Priority Industry Principles on Forced Labour. We played a leadership role in the development of these principles as a co-chair of the CGF’s Social Sustainability Committee, and we believe industry-wide focus and action on this issue is urgently needed. The Principles align with our existing human rights approach and provide an opportunity for us to strengthen work that seeks to identify and address forced labor. They are straightforward and when applied by industries at large, they may help stop situations that lead to forced labor – especially amongst vulnerable workers. CGF members have an agreed action plan to advance the Principles that includes a focus on forced labor in the seafood and palm oil industries in Southeast Asia.

Priority Industry Principles

AIM-PROGRESS
Mars serves on the Leadership Team of AIM-PROGRESS, the manufacturing and supplier forum promoting responsible sourcing practices and supplier capability building. Through AIM-Progress we work with peer companies to support awareness raising and select trainings related to forced labor.
UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT (UNGC)
In 2015, Mars became a signatory of the Global Compact. We issue an annual communication of progress that outlines our efforts across the Compact’s ten principles, which include seeking to eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labor.
AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAIN FORUMS AND CERTIFICATIONS
We participate in a number of multi-stakeholder forums whose mandates include action on human rights and forced labor in global supply chains, such as the World Cocoa Foundation, the Sustainable Seafood Taskforce, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and others across our priority raw materials. We also work closely with all three major global certification organizations: Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade and UTZ.

Looking
Ahead

Addressing forced labor, including modern slavery and human trafficking, will continue to require concerted action by businesses and close collaboration across sectors.
We are committed to moving forward and to working closely with others to drive progress. As we advance this work in 2017, we are focused on the following areas.
✓ Strengthening Policies: Reviewing our human rights policies and standards to ensure they are robust and consistent.
✓ Performance Measures: Establishing and deploying human rights key performance indicators (KPIs) focused
on impact and a framework to measure the effectiveness of our programs.
✓ Engaging Across Sectors: Continuing to engage in industry and multi-stakeholder platforms on forced labor, including modern slavery
and human trafficking, driving action and deepening dialogues.
✓ Supplier Engagement: Improving our engagement of and support to suppliers and extended supply chain actors operating in high-risk
human rights supply chains.
✓ Transparency: Sharing additional information publicly about our human rights progress and overall approach, and engaging more
closely with our stakeholders on this topic.

This statement constitutes the modern slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending December 31, 2016 of Mars, Incorporated and all its applicable subsidiaries which fall within the scope of section 54(2) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.

HYATT HOTELS CORPORATION HUMAN RIGHTS STATEMENT

Hyatt Hotels Corporation is a global hospitality company with widely recognized, industry leading brands and a tradition of innovation developed over our almost sixty-year history. We develop, own, operate, manage, franchise, license or provide services to a portfolio of properties, consisting of full service hotels, select service hotels, resorts and other properties, including timeshare, fractional and other forms of residential and vacation properties.
Hyatt has a long-standing commitment to support and respect the fundamental protection of human rights as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We believe that we have a responsibility to manage our business in a manner that is consistent with fundamental human rights and we attempt to foster similar ideals in those with whom we do business, including our owners, franchise operators and suppliers. This commitment is aligned with our Company core values and is supported by both our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our corporate social responsibility and diversity and inclusion strategies. Our Board of Directors oversees Hyatt executive officers and the management of the Company to ensure that our principles are consistently integrated across the Company.
Ethical Business Conduct Hyatt’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires that business be conducted with honesty and integrity, and in compliance with all applicable laws. Company policies and practices establish clear ethical standards and guidelines for how we do business and also establish accountability. All associates are required to obey applicable laws and comply with specific standards relating to legal obligations, ethics, and business conduct. We have clear accountability mechanisms in place to encourage reporting of compliance with these standards.
Hyatt promotes an open door policy to encourage the reporting of any violations of company policy, misconduct or mistreatment. Hyatt also maintains a reporting tool through a website, www.hyattethics.com, and a dedicated toll-free number, to provide a way to anonymously and confidentially report activities that potentially may involve criminal, unethical or otherwise inappropriate behavior in violation of applicable law and/or Hyatt’s established policies.
Human Rights of Our Colleagues We respect the human rights of our colleagues including freedom from discrimination, forced or compulsory labor as well as freedom of association. We have a long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion and remain dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all colleagues.
Protection of the Rights of Children Hyatt complies with all applicable laws prohibiting the use of child labor and supports legislation to prevent and punish the crime of sexual exploitation of children. In keeping with our mission, Hyatt is committed to seeking to raise awareness concerning such exploitation, and will cooperate with law enforcement authorities to address any such instances of exploitation of which the Company becomes aware.
Elimination of Human Trafficking/Modern Slavery Given the nature of our business, we are sensitive to the existence of human trafficking and we are

committed to working to establish steps that help prevent the use of Hyatt hotels for trafficking and to raise awareness concerning such exploitation wherever Hyatt hotels are located. We cooperate with law enforcement authorities in jurisdictions where Hyatt hotels are located. We also support efforts to eliminate forced labor and are publishing this statement in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015. We are committed to following all applicable employment related laws, including pay, overtime and work conditions, and insuring that Hyatt is a place where people can be their best.
The following are some of the ways that we express our commitment to combating human trafficking and modern slavery:
• Mandatory global human trafficking training program for managed hotels. Human trafficking training is a Hyatt brand standard and we make our training available for our franchise partners. In 2015, approximately 55,000 of our colleagues were required to take the training, which is integrated into Hyatt’s onboarding process and compliance training.
• Hyatt worked in partnership with the International Tourism Partnership and our industry partners to develop the International Tourism Partnership’s Position Statement on Human Trafficking.
• Hyatt blocked onsite access to several websites commonly used for human trafficking across all U.S. hotels.
• Hyatt regularly works with local law enforcement officials in preparation for and during international sporting events to create heightened awareness around human trafficking.
• Signatory to ECPAT’s Code of Conduct (The Code). The Code specifically focuses on the protection of children from sexual exploitation in the travel and tourism industries.
• Hyatt supports the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Blue Campaign – a comprehensive program to end human trafficking.
• Hyatt strictly adheres to employment laws respecting pay and hours worked and promotes respect and dignity with our suppliers through our Supplier Code of Conduct.
• Hyatt supports programs around the world that help to prepare vulnerable youth with life and hospitality skills through partnerships that include Youth Career Initiative.
Hyatt continuously assesses evolving human rights issues that have the potential to intersect with our business. Given the complexity of these issues, especially in a global context, we frequently collaborate with industry groups and experts to shape our knowledge and awareness of human rights. For example, Hyatt works in close partnership with the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) and is a leading member of the organization’s Human Rights working group, where we are working with our industry peers to:
• Identify appropriate mechanisms to address human rights issues throughout the value chain, from direct employment to construction and supply chains
• Identify appropriate human rights key evaluation indicators to implement guidance and define targets • Develop relevant training and other resources for those working in the industry
We are committed to respecting the rights of all parties consistent with applicable law and to continued dialogue on the principles espoused in this statement as we fulfill our mission as an organization.

176,"Modern Slavery Act Statement
Introduction
Actis is committed to promoting world-class standards in health and safety, environmental protection, social issues and business integrity (including sound corporate governance and transparent accounting). This includes taking all reasonable steps to eliminate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in any part of our business or primary supply chain.
Modern slavery generally encompasses slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking. Traffickers and slave drivers coerce, deceive and force individuals against their will into a life of abuse, servitude and inhumane treatment.
This statement is issued on behalf of Actis LLP, Actis GP LLP and their UK incorporated subsidiaries (together “Actis”) pursuant to Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) in respect of the financial year ending on 31 December 2018. Actis LLP and Actis GP LLP are regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority.
Our business
Actis is a global platform and a leading investor in growth markets across Africa, Asia and Latin America and focuses on investments within the Private Equity, Energy, Real Estate, and Infrastructure sectors. We invest with an exclusive focus on intra-growth market investing (our 'south-south' approach): sharing knowledge and experience across regions and businesses to help deliver consistent competitive returns, responsibly. Founded in 2004, we have an unparalleled heritage in growth markets, set within a culture of active ownership. We have raised USD$15bn since inception and we operate through 16 offices globally.
Our responsible investment approach
Investing responsibly is particularly important in the markets where we invest. We aim to ensure that civic society, our investors, our employees and the wider community all benefit from our investment activities as we work to build successful sustainable businesses.
Actis has been a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) since 2009, and has reported publicly to the PRI since 2010. In 2015, PRI launched a Reporting and Assessment process to measure signatories’ ESG activities and reporting frameworks, for which Actis achieved an A+ rating.
Our responsible investment (RI) approach means that across all sectors we actively seek opportunities to create long-term, sustainable value and we integrate an assessment of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards into our investment decision making (see the following link: Actis Environmental, Social and Governance Code). This approach means that:
 before making an investment our due diligence review will consider the operational risks of the relevant business (which will include an assessment of supply chain risk); and
1

 post investment, we seek to apply international ESG standards across our portfolio, regardless of the local regulatory environment.
As part of this approach we also recognise the importance of engaging with our business partners to encourage them to adopt such standards and we expect them to understand and share our commitment to integrating the management of those standards and practices into their business processes. This includes responsible supply chain management processes.
We maintain a full-time in-house team of ESG professionals to support the development and implementation of our policies and best practice.
Our Social issues policy
The objectives of our Social issues policy are:
 to treat all Actis employees fairly and to respect their dignity, well-being and diversity;
 to require the businesses in which Actis invests to treat all of their employees and contractors fairly, and to respect their dignity, well-being and diversity;
 to be objective, consistent and fair with all Actis stakeholders;
 to work towards full compliance of Actis investments with the International Labour Organisation Fundamental Conventions, the UN Declaration of Human Rights and IFC Performance Standard 2: Labour and Working Conditions; and
 to comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.
In addition, our policy is that Actis aims only to invest in businesses which:
 do not employ forced labour of any kind, either directly or via their primary supply chain; and
 do not allow children to form part of their workforce, either directly or via their primary supply chain.
Modern Slavery Act
Actis does not support and is not aware of any dealings with any business which is involved in modern slavery and we will not knowingly work with any party who we suspect is connected with any such conduct or behaviour. Nonetheless we recognise the heightened risk of becoming involved with modern slavery in some of the countries where Actis has a presence and where we invest, primarily where we engage with contractors or third party service providers.
In the event that we became aware of a heightened risk of modern slavery with respect to our own operations or any investment in our portfolio, then we would require the development of a clearly articulated action plan as to how that risk was to be addressed
2

and eliminated. In all such scenarios our objective would be to have a zero tolerance of any form of modern slavery.
Our supply chain
A supply chain is a system of organisations, people and activities to bring a product or service from inception to the sale and delivery of such product or service to the end user.
As a manager of alternative investment Funds, Actis’ supply chain is relatively short, and is comprised of predominantly professional and business service providers. As the relationship between (i) a fund (and its manager) and (ii) a portfolio company is one of investor to investee, and not a relationship based on the supply of goods or services, our investment portfolio does not form part of our supply chain. Similarly, our non UK offices fall outside ambit of the Act. However, our responsible investment approach means that we are equally committed to address the risk of modern slavery and to eliminate its existence, regardless of whether it arises in our own operations or in our investments (and regardless of geography).
Our own operations
We make a risk assessment as to whether our contractors and third party service providers (“suppliers”) are likely to be affected by modern slavery and this includes considering the type of business in question and the location from which the relevant service is provided.
Generally, we manage the risk of such suppliers having an involvement with modern slavery through a number of mitigating controls including:
 general due diligence and referencing of the relevant parties prior to their engagement;
 a risk assessment of suppliers to determine whether specific and bespoke due diligence measures are appropriate (e.g. site visits or agreeing with certain suppliers what mitigating steps are required);
 the provision of a clear statement as to what we expect with respect to any connection with modern slavery (and our zero tolerance approach);
 ongoing monitoring of any material change in the risk associated with a particular supplier (which may result in specific actions being implemented - e.g. ceasing to use an existing supplier); and
 the use of counter parties who we believe to be reputable.
Our investments
As part of our existing responsible investment approach, we undertake ESG due diligence at the time of investment. Alongside many other ESG risks, the risk of slavery and human trafficking is assessed and, if necessary, detailed due diligence would be undertaken to ensure that the company’s operations do not involve these activities.
3

For each of our investments, we request that management/our business partners sign up to an ESG undertaking as part of the shareholders agreement. Whilst this has always referred to fair treatment of employees with respect to remuneration and conditions of employment, in 2017 this was enhanced to include a reference to ensuring that modern slavery is not taking place within the business and its operations, including its primary supply chain.
For those companies whose operations may give rise to a potential risk of modern slavery in their supply chains, our Responsible Investing and deal teams work closely with management to strengthen and improve systems and controls to mitigate this risk. This would include, for example, ensuring that a robust Responsible Sourcing policy and programme was in place.
Our policies
We have always had a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery across our business. With respect to our own operations our Supplier Code of Conduct clearly sets out (i) the standards our suppliers are expected to adopt in relation to managing their business operations, including their primary supply chain and (ii) the sanctions for breach of that Code. With respect to our investments, our Social issues policy makes specific reference to forced and child labour, supply chain risk and appropriate labour practices.
Actis’ Supplier Code of Conduct is available here: Supplier Code of Conduct. Actis’ Social issues policy and its other policies in relation to Health and Safety, the Environment and Business Integrity are available here: Actis Environmental, Social and Governance Code.
Effectiveness and training
During 2019 we will continue to monitor our supply chain and our portfolio with a view to identifying and managing any heightened risk of modern slavery.
We will also keep under review what ongoing training is appropriate for our staff, particularly those who manage key supplier relationships and those deal team members who are involved in the management of higher risk investments.
Actis maintains a dedicated whistleblower facility which may be used by anyone who has questions or concerns relating to the conduct of Actis, its people or its companies. This facility provides access to our Responsible Investing team via RI@act.is and may be used by anyone who has concerns with respect to Actis’ supply chain or its investments.
Approval
This statement was approved by the members of Actis LLP and Actis GP LLP on 4 June 2019.

One has 400 bedrooms with large conference and leisure facilities and three golf courses. The second hotel has 150 bedrooms with smaller conference and leisure facilities.
Our annual turnover is in excess of £50m.

Our supply chains principally relate to the sourcing of materials related to the provision of food and beverage and other activities that underpin the running of hotels, leisure facilities and golf courses. These are sourced predominantly in the UK.
OUR POLICIES ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business.

DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we have in place systems to:

Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement
This statement is made pursuant to S54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps the Company has taken during the financial year 1 March 2018 to 28 February 2019 to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our business.
Our organisation and business
Endsleigh Insurance Services Limited is a general insurance intermediary. Our head office is in Cheltenham and we have approximately 350 employees, all of whom are based in the UK. We were established in 1965, by NUS, to champion affordable insurance designed for students, when others wouldn't.
Today, we are still as committed to providing value for money. Using our expertise we have extended our products and services to professionals as well as to commercial and business customers, shaping protection for the things that matter most to our customers. We are proud of our heritage and expertise, aligning our solutions to our core markets of education, property owners, travel agencies and not-for-profit organisations.
Our commitment
We are committed to ensuring that there is no slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour, abuse of power over vulnerable individuals, human trafficking or any other form of exploitation as contemplated by the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We see our business as a place where people can flourish in a supportive environment.
Our supply chains
Our supply chain includes recognised UK insurers all of which are authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. We also use IT and telephony companies. We do not act as a producer or manufacturer or retailer of physical goods and therefore have no supply chain in relation to these activities.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We have a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery which reflects our approach to acting ethically and with integrity in our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems that ensure that we do not undertake business activities with any organisation that may be exposed to slavery and human trafficking.
Assessment of modern slavery risk within our supply chain and due diligence
We have increased our focus on modern slavery and have undertaken a risk assessment to determine where the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking could arise. All employees in the company work at an office owned or leased by the company. We have clear policies for engagement and contracting individuals.
We understand that the greatest risk of modern slavery and human trafficking is in emerging markets. We do not trade outside of the UK however, we have conducted due diligence of those suppliers that we believe may be exposed to such a risk.
Further steps
We continue to undertake training of employees to ensure that they understand the risks and comply with our required standards.

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING ANNUAL STATEMENT
1 January - 31 December 2017
This statement is made by Cambridge Associates Limited (“CA”, the “firm” and “we”) in accordance with Section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) for the financial year ending 31 December 2017. It has been approved by the Board of Directors, signed by a member of the Board of Directors and published on the firm’s website with a link in a prominent place on the London homepage at www.cambridgeassociates.com.
Introduction
CA is committed to acting in full compliance with the Act and to ensuring that any form of forced or bonded labour, servitude or human trafficking (collectively referred to as “slavery” in this statement) is not taking place in any part of its business or in any of its supply chains. This is integral to our Code of Ethics which underpin all our activities. This statement sets out the steps we have taken to address the risks of slavery.
Our Organisation
CA is established and operates as a limited company under English law, and authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. It is (indirectly) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cambridge Associates LLC, a global outsourcing, discretionary management and advisory services firm with highly ranked practices in foundations and endowments, pensions, and private client, with 11 offices throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The firm is owned by shareholders which includes the founders and has a global Management Board which ensures that all its offices work together effectively to achieve its goals.
As a professional services provider, CA predominantly employs and contracts the services of professionally qualified people. The firm also contracts office support services including for catering, office supplies, IT, recruitment, property, cleaning, security, maintenance and construction services. CA’s suppliers outside the UK are primarily other CA offices which in turn contract a similar range of support services locally.
Further information can be found at www.cambridgeassociates.com.
Risks
The risk of slavery in the firm’s supply chains has been assessed as low, with the principal area of risk residing in the supply chains of the firm’s direct suppliers and contractors of office support services, particularly those in higher-risk jurisdictions outside the UK. However, we fully recognise that this task requires vigilance.
CA continues to look for ways to improve its approach to eradicate modern slavery and ensure that its policies and procedures are robust and effective in doing so.

Amazon continually works to prevent slavery and human trafficking from taking place in our manufacturing supply chains and operations, in line with the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act.
Our Business
Amazon.com opened its virtual doors on the World Wide Web in July 1995. We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising services and cobranded credit card agreements. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations.
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 566,000 full-time and part-time employees. However, employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils, statutory employee representation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within the United States.
Amazon is committed to improving the working conditions of people around the world who are a part of our supply chain and business. Amazon sources products and services for many of its businesses around the world, including sourcing private label products in several industries (including electronics, fashion, consumables, and furniture). With manufacturers and service providers spanning the Americas, Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa, we recognize the need to monitor for conditions that put workers at risk of forced labour.

Policies and Controls
Amazon’s internal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets out guiding principles and establishes that in performing job duties Amazon employees should always act lawfully, ethically, and in the best interests of Amazon.
Amazon commits publicly to addressing risk of slavery and human trafficking in its Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”). Amazon’s purchase and service agreements require our manufacturing suppliers and service providers supporting Amazon’s internal operations (e.g. call centers, delivery and fulfillment providers) to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct.
We evaluate and address risks of slavery and human trafficking in the Supplier Code which states, among other standards, that:
Our suppliers must not use forced labour - slave, prison, indentured, bonded, or otherwise. Our suppliers must not traffic workers or in any other way exploit workers by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction, or fraud. Working must be voluntary, and workers must be free to leave work and terminate their employment or other work status with reasonable notice. Workers shall not be required to pay recruitment, hiring, or other similar fees related to their employment; our suppliers must bear or reimburse to their workers the cost of any such fees. All fees and expenses charged to workers must be disclosed to Amazon and communicated to workers in their native language in advance of employment. Our suppliers must not require workers to surrender government issued identification, passports, or work permits as a condition of working, and our suppliers may only temporarily hold onto such documents to the extent reasonably necessary to complete legitimate administrative and immigration processing. Workers must be given clear, understandable contracts regarding the terms and conditions of their engagement in a language understood by the worker. Suppliers must ensure that each of its staffing or recruiting agencies comply with this Supplier Code and with the more stringent of the applicable laws of the country where work is performed and the worker’s home country.
Due Diligence Processes
Amazon assesses manufacturing suppliers and service providers for continued compliance and improvement. Amazon uses a risk-based approach to determine the frequency of assessments and which manufacturing suppliers and service providers should be assessed. Many sites are assessed multiple times a year, including through follow-up assessments to address specific findings. Amazon

may terminate its relationships with any supplier that violates our Supplier Code or does not cooperate during assessments. Assessments may include:
Site inspection of all areas of the site and any living quarters; Confidential worker interviews or surveys conducted without site management present; Review and analysis of site documents or licenses to assess workers' age, contracts, compensation, working hours, and workplace conditions; Identification of past compliance issues, areas for improvement, and development of a remediation plan.
Audit reports and findings are reviewed regularly by senior leadership and corrective action plans are implemented as needed. Amazon tracks remediation closely and conducts follow-up audits for significant issues. Between audits, Amazon employees meet on-site with supplier managers to discuss open issues and remediation progress.
Suppliers are required to remediate violations of Amazon’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Suppliers must submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) providing both a root cause analysis and a description of remedy. Amazon evaluates CAPs in light of the severity level of the violation.
Risk Management
To ensure that our policies and programs incorporate internationally recognized human rights standards, we conduct formal benchmarking with industry and multilateral groups to design, operate, and continually improve our risk assessment and audit program.
Amazon aligns with industry associations to collaborate on key issues and leverages their standardized assessments. Amazon is member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), has committed to implement the RBA Code of Conduct, leverages their standardized audits and participates in their working group on forced labour, the Responsible Labour Initiative. The Responsible Labour Initiative is a multi-stakeholder initiative, which develops resources, trainings, and strategies to address modern slavery. The Responsible Labour Initiative also works with labour agents and suppliers to understand the obstacles to remediation and identify potential solutions. In 2017, Amazon joined the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex) and began leveraging their globally-recognized social assessments to reduce audit duplication in our supply chain.
Assessment of Effectiveness
Suppliers manufacturing Amazon private label products are assessed for compliance with Amazon's Supplier Code of Conduct before Amazon begins ordering products, and we expect all of our suppliers and service providers to meet the standards in our Supplier Code of Conduct as a condition of doing business with us. These facilities must demonstrate the absence of any issue that has caused or is likely to cause immediate harm to workers or communities, or demonstrates egregious unethical behavior, including the use of forced or indentured labour, or human trafficking. In the event an issue that has caused or is likely to cause severe harm to workers is identified prior to beginning a relationship with Amazon, the issue must be resolved before, and as a condition of, initial production and to qualify for continued production with Amazon. Amazon’s sourcing teams have each taken on Social Responsibility goals to monitor for these conditions at an executive leadership level; performance against these goals is regularly reported to leadership.
The Social Responsibility team consults with Amazon business teams on new sourcing geographies and sourcing teams are responsible for reviewing supplier performance before moving to production.
Support and Capacity Building
We offer suppliers training to help understand Amazon requirements before audits, effectively navigate the Corrective Action Plan (CAP) process, and design and implement sustainable management systems after an audit. We have dedicated teams that work directly with suppliers and service providers in major geographies. We offer on-site and remote training to support continuous improvement. Suppliers are also encouraged to participate in external training programs, such as industry association tutorials related to recognizing and preventing forced labour and implementing management systems. We are continuously exploring ways to use Amazon’s expertise to expand this support.
Employees of Amazon take mandatory compliance training courses on the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Anti-Bribery Compliance, and Workplace Harassment. Additionally, the Amazon.com Legal Department has developed and maintains reporting guidelines for employees who wish to report violations of the Business Code of Conduct and Ethics. These guidelines include information on making reports to the Legal Department and to an independent third party.

and with reference to the guidelines issued by the Home Office, Transparency in
Supply Chains - A practical guide. It sets out the steps that Chang Hwa Commercial

It is contrary to the Bank's position to tolerate any form of slavery or human trafficking
in our operations, supply chain, products, services and activities. We expect the staff,
suppliers and business partners to adhere to the same high standards and to take
reasonable steps to ensure that other third parties they do business with also adhere to
those standards as well.

as modern slavery.
Whistleblowing procedures are in place to facilitate reporting, through email or
helplines, of concerns relating to slavery or human trafficking.
Due Diligence to ensure all business activities are conducted in a fair and
transparent manner. We assess our suppliers and business partners to have greater
knowledge about their legitimacy and to ensure they adhere to the same ethical
principles as we do.

186,"CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) was signed into law in the State of California on September 30, 2010. The Act goes into effect on January 1, 2012 and requires retail companies and manufacturers doing business in California with annual worldwide gross receipts of more than US$100 million to disclose corporate policies to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains.
American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO, Inc.) is committed to ensuring that the people who make our clothes are treated with dignity and respect. The following disclosure provides an overview of AEO, Inc.’s initiatives around human rights and social compliance, including steps we take to mitigate the risks of and work to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in our supplier base. For complete details about our Corporate Responsibility efforts, please see AE Better World.
• Vendor Code of Conduct & Supplier Agreement. AEO, Inc.’s Vendor Code of Conduct is based on universally-accepted human rights principles and sets forth our minimum standards and expectations for suppliers. Our Code expressly prohibits the use of child labor and forced or involuntary labor. These prohibitions include, but are not limited to, trafficked, prison, bonded, and indentured labor, as well as forced overtime.
All suppliers must agree contractually and in writing to abide by the terms of our Vendor Code of Conduct and other applicable laws and regulations before we do business with them. As part of this agreement, AEO, Inc. suppliers also warrant that any subcontractors they may independently contract with to produce AEO, Inc. product will comply with the terms of our Code and other applicable laws and regulations. For more details on our Code of Conduct as well as associated guiding principles and governance, please see the Corporate Governance section of AE Better World.
• Supplier Monitoring. AEO, Inc. maintains a dedicated team of people and an extensive factory monitoring program to help ensure that suppliers comply with the terms of our Vendor Code of Conduct. Through a combination of third-party auditors, local independent auditors, and our own inspectors, we conduct pre-sourcing inspections of apparel factories before we place purchase orders and strive to visit approved factories at least once a year. Inspections conducted by our internal team are generally unannounced, while inspections conducted by third-party auditors are semi-unannounced. AEO, Inc. team members review inspection results with factory management and provide targeted training to help suppliers continuously improve their compliance performance.
1|Page

AEO, Inc. has a zero tolerance policy against all forms of slavery and human trafficking. Factories that cannot meet minimum standards and pass our pre-sourcing inspections will not be approved for ongoing business. If and when we uncover a serious breach of our Code of Conduct by a supplier already approved for production, we take steps up to and including the severance of our business relationship. For more details about this and other aspects of our supplier monitoring program, please see the Supply Chain section of our website. Full results from our FY 2010 factory inspections are available here.
• External Verification. AEO, Inc. is a participating company in the Fair Labor Association. The FLA provides independent external monitoring of our supplier base and publicly reports on its findings. In addition, AEO, Inc. is also a signatory to the global buyer principles of the International Labor Organization (ILO)’s Better Work program and relies upon independent Better Work factory assessments in lieu of our own inspections in countries where Better Work operates. Current AEO, Inc. sourcing countries with active Better Work programs include Cambodia, Vietnam, Haiti, and Indonesia. More information about our work with the FLA and Better Work can be found here.
• Associate Training & Accountability. All AEO, Inc. associates must comply with the terms of AEO, Inc.’s Code of Ethics, which sets forth written standards designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct, legal and regulatory compliance, and full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable company public disclosure. Associates are required to report any known or suspected violations of the Code of Ethics either through the anonymous AEO Hotline (1-888-5873582) or online at www.aehotline.com. For more information on our Code of Ethics and related polices, please click here.
Associates who engage regularly with suppliers are trained on our Vendor Code of Conduct and supplier monitoring efforts. Entry-level Merchandising and Planning associates participate in a rotation program that includes a specific course in AEO, Inc. Corporate Responsibility. New Production and Sourcing associates participate in onboarding sessions about Corporate Responsibility policies and processes. AEO, Inc. associates who regularly visit suppliers are also asked to assess conditions informally while on location and report back any concerns. In addition, the AEO, Inc. Corporate Responsibility and Production teams meet regularly to review supplier performance on social compliance and discuss sourcing strategy. The Corporate Responsibility team reports to the AEO, Inc. Board of Directors on an annual basis. More details on these and our other Corporate Responsibility business integration efforts are available here.
• Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships. Most of the time, AEO, Inc. is just one of several brands doing business with any given factory. Because the root causes of poor working conditions are varied and complex, our leverage to bring about positive change can be limited. As a result, we engage other companies, civil society organizations, trade unions, governments, multilateral institutions, and other stakeholders on issues of mutual concern and who share our goals to improve global supply

187,"We expect all our contractors, suppliers and other business partners to adopt the same high standard as we do in the pursuit to prevent modern slavery, by ensuring all employees and workers are treated with dignity and respect in a fair and ethical environment. We regularly take steps to identify the areas of our business and supply chains that are most at risk in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking.
Assessing and managing risk We are aware that, in some cases, operating in the hospitality industry and using partners based across the world can create a higher risk of modern slavery. To address these risks we look to develop partnerships with suppliers so that we have a greater understanding of how they work, and they understand our standards and expectations. We also remain vigilant to any activities which might give cause for concern.
Looking ahead We will look to establish internal accountability, and provide relevant personnel with training to recognise environment, health, safety, and labour/worker concerns, including issues relating to slavery, human trafficking and forced labour, and to report and investigate suspicions of improper conduct at all suppliers globally. Part of this means that if any of our suppliers are found to be falling foul of the standards we set, we will look to work with them to redress our concerns and, if necessary terminate our relationship with them.
We will continue to monitor and develop our practices in respect of combatting slavery or human trafficking to target areas of its business where there is a potential risk of modern slavery. WorldVentures General Counsel is responsible for checking and testing the success of our commitments, and will work to ensure we meet our expectations.
This statement has been made pursuant to section 54(1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. It constitutes the slavery and human trafficking statement for WorldVentures Marketing, LLC, Rovia, LLC, and WorldVentures Events Limited and their subsidiaries that fall within the scope of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (collectively the ""Group"") for the financial year ending 31 December 2016. It sets out the steps taken by the Group during the financial year to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains.

189,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Statement on Human Trafficking and Forced Labor
1. SUMMARY
AMD has a long-standing commitment to upholding high standards of corporate responsibility. This commitment extends to respecting the human rights of individuals directly impacted by AMD’s global operations. We are also mindful of this commitment throughout our business relationships.
Our values and approach to human rights issues are guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011) and the UN Global Compact Principles (2000). Our membership in the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and adoption of the EICC Code of Conduct (2015) further augments our efforts.
AMD’s Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct outlines our expectations for ethical conduct and human rights commitments for AMD employees, agents and contractors. Training on these standards is periodically required for all AMD employees, agents and contractors. In addition, AMD has adopted the EICC Code of Conduct in our own manufacturing operations and as our Supplier Code of Conduct. We believe that these industry-wide standards are efficient and effective ways to integrate social, environmental, and ethical responsibilities into the electronics industry supply chain. The EICC Code is substantially consistent with our Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct and provides additional clarity on AMD’s expectations of our suppliers with regard to labor, health and safety, environmental policies, as well as ethical practices and management systems.
AMD is committed to respecting human rights. AMD prohibits the use forced labor in providing its products or services, and prohibits physical abuse, or harassment or retaliation against employees reporting such behavior. AMD strictly forbids forced labor practices and human trafficking in any AMD operation or in the operations of our suppliers that provide services or products directly associated with AMD products. In addition, AMD promotes its efforts to identify and eradicate forced labor and human trafficking in its Corporate Responsibility Report.
Finding forced labor or human trafficking in either our supply chain or our own business operations would constitute a severe violation of our standards of business conduct. The following outlines AMD’s policies and practices for identifying and eliminating these practices, if found, in our supply chain as well as AMD’s attempts to influence the behavior of the broader electronics industry.
2. DUE DILIGENCE
Pursuant to our own policies and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB657) and the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act of 2015 (Chapter 30, Part 6, Provision 54), AMD has established policies and programs aimed at prohibiting forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain and in our business operations as outlined below.
A. Definitions
AMD has adopted internationally recognized definitions of forced labor and human trafficking. Further, AMD recognizes that forced labor and human trafficking can occur through more subtle means such as accumulated debt, retention of identity papers or threats of denunciation to immigration authorities.

Forced Labor: The International Labor Organization’s fundamental Convention on Forced Labor prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor, which is defined as “all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.”
Human Trafficking: The United Nations defines trafficking in persons as: “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.”
B. Scope of diligence activities
AMD is a semiconductor design firm. In 2015, AMD announced a joint venture that, upon close, will result in its back-end manufacturing assets being transferred to a joint venture, in which AMD will retain a 15% interest. Absent a controlling role in any manufacturing facilities, AMD’s global workforce is primarily made up of highly trained professionals with engineers as the largest demographic. The risk of forced labor and human trafficking is primarily in AMD’s supply chain. The company utilizes several approaches to communicate our expectations regarding the prohibition of such practices to our manufacturing suppliers.
C. Description of AMD’s manufacturing supply chain
“Manufacturing Suppliers” contribute materials that directly impact and become a part of AMD products. This includes wafer fabrication, outsourced assembly and test (OSAT), direct materials (substrates, lids, capacitors, memory), and boards inclusive of components. The majority of AMD’s manufacturing suppliers have multi-year business relationships with the company.
The largest portion of AMD’s overall supplier spending is with its fabrication foundry partners. Manufacturing suppliers operate facilities in a diverse range of countries around the world. The predominance of manufacturing supplier facilities are located in Asia. AMD utilizes tools provided by EICC to assess risks of forced labor and human trafficking in the countries where our manufacturing supplier’s factories are located.
D. Establishing clear expectations
AMD is an active member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and AMD’s Senior Director of Corporate Responsibility served as the Chairman of the Board for two years (2013 and 2014). AMD was a leader in the development of the 2015 revision to the EICC Code of Conduct that significantly strengthened its standards for prohibiting forced labor and human trafficking.
AMD has adopted the EICC Code of Conduct and requires conformance with this Code in its contracts with manufacturing suppliers. In addition, AMD issues an annual “assurance letter” to suppliers outlining our corporate responsibility expectations.
The EICC Code of Conduct is based on international labor, environmental and human rights standards which include strict prohibition of forced labor and human trafficking. Section A.1 of the Code states, among other standards, that: “Forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery or trafficking of persons shall not be used.”

Each year, AMD communicates with manufacturing suppliers in writing to ensure that AMD’s expectations and requirements are clear and up-to-date with regard to responsible social, ethical and environmental conduct. This annual letter establishes AMD’s expectation and requirement that its suppliers comply with applicable laws and regulations as well as the EICC Code of Conduct, whichever is more stringent. Additionally, AMD’s standard contractual terms and conditions for the procurement of goods and services require conformance to applicable laws and regulations, the EICC Code of Conduct, and reinforce our expectations regarding responsible social, ethical and environmental conduct.
E. Supplier risk assessments
As a part of AMD’s supplier management process, AMD assesses suppliers that meet certain risk criteria to evaluate their potential conformance to the EICC Code of Conduct. This approach relies on several sources of information including but not limited to:
A. The Maplecroft Risk Assessment tool. This is a third party service provided through our EICC membership that evaluates risks of forced labor and human trafficking by location.
B. The EICC Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire. This is a detailed self-evaluation questionnaire regarding our supplier’s work policies, practices, employee demographics and other information designed to assess potential conformance to the EICC Code.
AMD uses the risk assessment to prioritize our monitoring and conformance activities with our suppliers.
F. Supplier audits
Based on the results of the risk assessment, AMD may require a supplier to engage a third-party specially trained in social and environmental auditing to conduct an on-site audit of supplier conformance to the EICC Code of Conduct. In some cases, AMD may rely on EICC qualified third party audit reports that were previously conducted at the supplier’s request or at the request of another party. AMD will only accept audit reports that adhere to the EICC standardized process which include specific procedures to determine the presence of forced labor and human trafficking.
G. Accountability and corrective actions
AMD discusses conformance to the EICC Code of Conduct with our suppliers during regular business reviews. AMD’s supplier business reviews are an effective venue for accountability with regard to responsible social, ethical and environmental conduct because senior management of both AMD and the supplier participate in these meetings and the awarding of future business is directly impacted by the results of such reviews.
In the event that violations of the EICC Code of Conduct or AMD’s Standards of Business Conduct are discovered, AMD requires that the supplier rectify these in a timely manner. Discovery of forced labor or human trafficking is considered a severe violation of AMD policy that requires the supplier’s immediate corrective actions. Such actions may include, without limitation, the termination or reduction of business with supplier, required remediation plans, onsite compliance auditing, employee compensation at supplier’s expense, and/or termination of AMD’s contract with the supplier.
H. Training
AMD suppliers have access to information and training regarding conformance expectations and methods through EICC’s eLearning Academy. EICC’s eLearning Academy contains online learning modules that cover compliance with the

EICC Code of Conduct, as well as modules specifically related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. Suppliers may also access modules focused on hiring procedures designed to eliminate forced and trafficked labor.
Training focused on EICC Code conformance is available to AMD procurement staff. In addition, every AMD employee is required to take training on conformance with AMD’s Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct. With regard to the prohibition on forced and trafficked labor practices, these standards are substantially equivalent to the EICC Code of Conduct. In the event an employee violates these standards, AMD will take immediate and appropriate action, which may include termination of employment.
I. Reporting
AMD publishes an annual corporate responsibility report and website with the most recent information on its supplier responsibility program including the due diligence activities described in this statement.

190,"MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT

The Modern Slavery Act (“MSA”) came into force in the United Kingdom in 2015 requiring large organisations doing business in the UK to produce a “Slavery and Human Trafficking” statement. The Act applies to both organisation subsidiaries and the parent organisation if they carry on a business or part of a business in the UK.
This Statement1 relates the steps that BNP Paribas has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in its direct operations or supply chains. It also refers to the risk management process the Group has put in place to mitigate any potential human rights violation from its financing and investment activities. This Statement is for the financial year ended 31 December 2016. The Board and CEO attest annually that the Group complies with this Statement through the information provided by the respective departments of Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”), Procurement and Human Resources.
Introduction
BNP Paribas is a leading bank in Europe with an international reach. It has a presence in 74 countries, with more than 190,000 employees, including more than 146,000 in Europe. The Group has key positions in its three main activities: Domestic Markets and International Financial Services (whose retailbanking networks and financial services are covered by Retail Banking & Services) and Corporate & Institutional Banking, which serves two client franchises: corporate clients and institutional investors.
BNP Paribas has had a presence in the UK for nearly 150 years. The UK is a key hub for the Group with a presence across BNP Paribas’ core businesses: Corporate & Institutional Banking and Retail Banking & Services. There are about 7,500 employees in the UK with more than half based in and around London.
BNP Paribas seeks to be a contributor to responsible and sustainable global development. The Bank’s ambition is to have a positive impact on its stakeholders and on the wider society. That is why the Group upholds the highest standard of conduct and ethics in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.

1 This Statement applies to all companies within the BNP Paribas Group that are required to have a slavery and modern trafficking statement, except where they have chosen to produce their own statement.

Our commitment and policies

BNP Paribas is committed to respecting a number of principles and norms which underpin the way it does business:
- The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; - The 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact; - The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; - The internationally-accepted OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises; - The internationally-accepted standards of Human Rights, as defined in the International Bill of
Human Rights; - The core labour standards set out by the International Labour Organisation.
In addition to these public commitments, Group Policies are in place, which contribute to tackling numerous subjects on social, environmental and governance issues, including Human Rights violations. These include:
- BNP Paribas Group Code of Conduct; - Statement of BNP Paribas on Human Rights; - BNP Paribas Suppliers Charter.
Our employees

BNP Paribas commits to offer a working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity. The employees should not make any discrimination vis-à-vis any other person within the Group. Everyone has the responsibility to behave professionally and responsibly with their colleagues, which means: be pro-active in knowing and complying with the Group’s permanent policies, procedures and other instructions given by management relating to professional activities; respect applicable professional secrecy rules at all times; treat all colleagues with respect; make sure that interactions with colleagues are professional and effective at all times; listen to and value the input from colleagues, even if they express different views.
Raising concerns
Within the framework of the Group whistleblowing procedure, all BNP Paribas employees are entitled to report a proven or suspected breach of the Group’s Code of Conduct or of a Group policy, procedure or regulation, not only to their line manager, but also, alternatively, to the Compliance Function of the entity to which they belong or to a higher entity.
Any concern about an issue or a suspicion on human rights within the BNP Paribas business operations or in the supply chain can be reported in accordance with the Group whistleblowing procedure, unless local regulations or procedures provide otherwise.
Our whistleblowing policy ensures that anyone raising in good faith such concerns will not suffer, as a result, dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment.

Our suppliers
BNP Paribas believes that the behaviour of suppliers must also adhere to its commitments on environmental, social and governance issues.
The Group Procurement central team in France has a governance role across geographies and, as such, has drafted Procurement norms and standards which are applicable across the Group. The Group Procurement norms foresee that environmental and social criteria must be taken into consideration in the suppliers’ selection process.
These Procurement norms cover the Procurement process, i.e. the steps going from the internal needs analysis to the selection of the supplier and the contract. The main spend categories are IT (hardware, software and IT services), professional services, facilities management, real estate and travel.
In 2016, BNP Paribas has initiated a Know Your Supplier process that covers financial security controls on suppliers. These controls measure regulatory compliance of suppliers in terms of sanctions and embargoes, money laundering and financial crime related issues. The intention is to include also progressively controls relating to Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) criteria.
Concerning specifically adverse impacts on human rights, at the date of the statement, the information reported below principally addresses global spending managed from France.
BNP Paribas Group Procurement has implemented the following steps to mitigate environmental or social risks in its supply chain:
- The identification of environmental and social risks on its spend categories through a risk mapping review;
- A BNP Paribas Suppliers policy that requests suppliers to comply with environmental and social laws and regulations in the countries where they operate, as well as with the social principles outlined in the following reference texts:  Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and its two additional covenants;  Conventions of the International Labour Organization, in particular regarding minimum age and child labour and abolition of forced and compulsory labour;
- The inclusion of a sustainability questionnaire in calls for tenders that requires suppliers to sign up to the BNP Paribas Suppliers Charter, in particular the clauses on ethics and human rights, as well as disclose their current commitments and practices in regards to all matters of social, environmental and governance performance;
- The inclusion of contractual clauses in supplier contract standard templates, that requires the suppliers to observe the principles of the conventions of the International Labor Organization in all countries in which it operates and to make every effort to ensure its application by its own suppliers, subcontractors and distributors.
In 2016, a dedicated project to implement the MSA regulation has been implemented in our UK Branch, in line with the Group policies.

Our clients
BNP Paribas serves nearly 32 million individual customers and 1 million professionals, entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized enterprises and large corporate clients in industries with multiple Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues, and operates in countries where legal and governance systems are at diverse levels of development.
BNP Paribas strives to mitigate any potential violation of social or environmental rights, including human rights, from its financing and investment activities. Its ESG risk management system2 is Group wide and based on:
- The development of financing and investment policies managing the Group’s activities in sectors with significant ESG issues;
- The respect of the Equator Principles for major industrial and infrastructure projects; - The implementation of a specific ESG risk assessment framework for its products and services.
Awareness and Training
BNP Paribas took part in the development of an awareness-raising e-learning module called “Business and Human Rights” and co-created with the other members of the French association “Entreprises pour les droits de l’Homme” (Enterprises for Human Rights – “EDH”). Aimed at employees of EDH member companies, this module is included in the BNP Paribas training catalogue. It is mandatory for all employees who directly contribute to the promotion of Human Rights: Risk people, Procurement business lines, business relations officers in CIB and the CSR network.
This initiative is monitored by one of the thirteen managing indicators of the BNP Paribas’ CSR strategy: the “percentage of employees contributing directly to the promotion of Human Rights who have received a specific training”. This indicator is also one of the nine CSR indicators used in calculating the deferred variable compensation of the Group’s 5,000 top managers, accounting for 20% of the conditions for attributing this compensation.

Modern Slavery Statement
Last Revision Date: June, 2017
This slavery and human trafficking statement is made by Kroll pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ""Act"") for the financial year ending on 30 September 2016. It sets out the steps taken by Kroll to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not present in our business or direct supply chain.
About Kroll
Kroll is the leading global provider of risk solutions, providing a wide range of investigations, cyber security, due diligence and compliance, physical and operational security, and data and information management services. Headquartered in New York with more than 35 offices in 20 countries, Kroll has a multidisciplinary team of nearly 1,000 employees and serves a global clientele of law firms, financial institutions, corporations, non-profit institutions, government agencies, and individuals.
In providing a range of compliance, due diligence and investigative services to clients for over 40 years, Kroll has developed expertise in identifying and investigating issues in supply chains, helping clients to mitigate not only the risk of modern slavery but other common risks such as corruption, fraud and other white collar crime.
Our supply chain
At Kroll, we consider ourselves to be relatively low risk in relation to modern slavery, given the services we provide and the type of suppliers we use. Our key supply chain comprises our global network of service and information providers, many of whom are highly skilled experts and industry specialists. We periodically review our use of suppliers and, as necessary, adapt our processes if we determine that our risk has changed.
Our approach to combatting modern slavery
Kroll is committed to conducting business in a responsible and ethical manner. We have a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and expect the same high standards and commitment from those we do business with.
Kroll’s internal policies and procedures aim to ensure that effective systems and controls are in place to prevent slavery and human trafficking from occurring in any part of our business. Kroll’s Code of Conduct and Business Ethics promotes a culture of integrity by establishing principles for how we deal with our clients, employees and the public. Amongst other things, the values and rules set out in the Code encourage us to foster a safe, healthy and productive workplace and to maintain accountability at all levels of the organisation. Employees are encouraged to report any concerns they may have, including in relation to the occurrence of slavery or human trafficking, either to management or through an anonymous ethics helpline.
Suppliers forming a key part of Kroll’s supply chain, for example, those who assist us in our provision of services to clients, undergo a standardized vetting process, with the use of template agreements and a standard questionnaire to gather relevant information. The Kroll Compliance business also runs due diligence reports on all of these suppliers as part of the vetting process. All suppliers must be vetted and approved before they can be used on any engagement. The vetting process is designed as a risk mitigation measure to provide the best service for our clients and to protect and enhance the Kroll brand. Kroll has updated its UK supplier documentation to specifically refer to the Act and now requires each supplier to certify that they comply with the Act or equivalent principles.
Next steps
Going forward, Kroll will continue to review and update policies and procedures with respect to this issue.

193,"The Provident Financial plc statement on the Modern Slavery Act 2015
This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out the steps taken by Provident Financial plc and its operating companies during the year ending 31st December 2018, to prevent the possibility of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring within its direct operations and supply chains. All information and data provided below is based on the 2018 financial year unless otherwise stated.
Our business
Provident financial plc and its operating companies (“the Group”) is a specialist non-standard lending group which operates across the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (ROI).
The average number of people employed by the Group across its three divisions as at 31 December 2018 stood at 5,708. Collectively, these people serve 2.4 million customers in the UK and ROI. Vanquis Bank is a supplier of credit cards in the non-standard credit market and has operations in Bradford, London and Chatham, Kent. The Consumer Credit Division (CCD), which operates under the Provident home credit and Satsuma brands, is headquartered in Bradford, with 139 branches across the UK and ROI. The third division, Moneybarn, is a non-standard vehicle finance company and has operations in Petersfield, Hampshire.
The Group is opposed to slavery and human trafficking in both its direct operations and in the indirect operations of its supply chains. As such, the Group will not knowingly support or do business with any organisation involved in slavery or human trafficking. This commitment is underpinned by the Group’s corporate policy on procurement and outsourcing and the Group’s corporate diversity, equality and inclusion policy which endorses the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organisation’s core standards. Other corporate policies, which support this commitment include the Health and Safety Policy, Whistleblowing Policy, Bribery Policy and Human Resources Policy.
Our supply chains
Following the appointment of a Group Chief Procurement Officer in 2018, there has been a strong focus on implementing a group-wide procurement model and system solution to deliver a stepchange transformation of the Group’s procurement processes. Prior to this, Provident Financial plc, along with its subsidiary businesses had individual procurement teams and processes unique to their own function, meaning the Group had multiple contracts with the same businesses as well as differing due diligence processes. The Group now has a clear vision of creating a group-wide procurement model which will bring efficiency to the supplier onboarding processes, as well as change in the wider business culture.
In 2018, the Group’s revenue was £1.1bn and its annual procurement spend was £192m. The majority of the Group’s tier one suppliers are based predominantly within the UK and ROI. These suppliers range in size and scale from small to medium-sized enterprises, to large multinational corporations. The highest area of spend for the Group is on professional services such as consultancy and legal fees as well as credit checking services. Other areas of high spend include IT licenses, advertising, and property rent and service charges.
Each of the Group’s operating companies have established due diligence processes and procedures to manage supply chain-based risks, and engage with suppliers to ensure that they comply with the Group’s policy requirements and meet legislative requirements. Prior to 2018, CCD introduced the

OneTrust platform within its operations to help automate its data privacy, information security and third-party risk management processes. The OneTrust platform allows CCD to demonstrate compliance with regulations (for example, the EU GDPR) and other policy commitments. Through the OneTrust platform, new suppliers are required to complete a corporate responsibility (CR) questionnaire as part of the due diligence process for the onboarding of new suppliers. Suppliers that CCD had contracts with prior to implementing OneTrust will also go through this due diligence process to ensure all suppliers of the company complete a CR questionnaire. This questionnaire covers the broader CR agenda and includes questions on topics such as community investment, environment and diversity inclusion. However, the core focus remains on understanding suppliers commitments to ensuring its supply chain is free from modern slavery and human trafficking. In order to do this, suppliers are firstly asked whether their turnover is over £36m. If they answer ‘yes’, they are required to simply provide the link to their modern slavery statement. If they answer ‘no’, they are required to outline the processes they have in place to prevent instances of modern slavery and human trafficking from arising in their supply chain and their direct operations.
The OneTrust platform will be implemented within both Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn during 2019, enabling the Group to introduce harmonised due diligence processes and procedures to manage supply chain-based risks, including those that relate to the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
The Group’s direct operations
In order to minimise the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring within the direct operations of the Group (ie through the staff that are employed by the group’s operating companies), a range of HR processes and procedures are in place. Each of the Group’s operating companies is required to collect evidence which shows that: the person being hired is the person they claim to be; the prospective employee has the right to work legally in the UK; the person has permission to do the type of work that is being offered to them and that they are not a criminal. The evidence described above is assured by conducting checks using information held on the National Fraud Database and credit reference agency databases, as well as through the carrying out of criminal record and driving licence checks. Prospective employees are also required to provide proof of ‘right to work’ documents in line with the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 and original photographic documents, for example, a valid passport.
The Group is also committed to the highest standards of equality, honesty, openness and accountability. Staff are encouraged to raise concerns relating to potential breaches of regulations, policy requirements and/or other grievances, either by contacting a line manager or by telephoning a dedicated external helpline in confidence. The Group’s whistleblowing helpline ‘Safecall’ is a 24hour whistleblowing helpline operated by an independent third party to ensure impartiality and confidentiality.
Our plans for the future
Following the publication of the Group’s first and second statements on the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Group has developed a broad understanding of the areas within its businesses that require further focus to identify potential risks which relate to modern slavery and human trafficking. To ensure that there is a high level of staff awareness of issues relating to modern slavery and human trafficking, particularly within the Group’s procurement and partnerships teams, the Group will seek to harmonise the due diligence processes and procedures used by the Group’s operating companies to manage supply chain-based risks, and develop metrics to measure the effectiveness of Group’s approach to ensuring that its supply chains are free from modern slavery and human trafficking.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act and has been approved by the Provident Financial plc board of directors and will be reviewed and updated at least annually.

Organisation

Internal measures

The Volkswagen Group is a stock corporation under German law with its headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. The Volkswagen Group is made up of the Automotive division and the Financial Services division. The Automotive division comprises twelve brands: Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT, SKODA, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Ducati, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Scania and MAN.
With the exception of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands, all brands in the Group Automotive division are separate legal entities.

Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct1
The Volkswagen Group Code of Conduct provides our employees with a practical guide, summarising the key basic principles for correct conduct and providing support should they ever face legal or ethical challenges. The observance of internationally recognized human rights forms part of this Code of Conduct. We act in accordance with the values set out in the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the declarations of the International Labour Organization (ILO).

The Financial Services division operates in the financial services sector. Its portfolio is concerned with dealer and customer financing, leasing, banking and insurance activities, fleet management and mobility offers. Volkswagen AG is the parent company of the Volkswagen Group. The Volkswagen Group and its brands are represented in all the relevant markets of the world. The key sales markets currently include Western Europe as well as China, the USA, Brazil and Mexico. For the manufacture of its products, the Group procures goods and services from all over the world. The Group operates 120 manufacturing sites in 20 European countries as well as 11 American, Asian and African countries.

The Volkswagen Group Whistleblower System²
Our employees, business partners and other third parties are provided with internal contact points as well as external ombudspersons in order to be able to report on legal and regulatory violations in connection with the Volkswagen Group (the ""whistleblower system"" of the Volkswagen Group). The suspicion of human rights violations can also be reported here. The references are dealt with in accordance with established procedural principles in order to ensure the best possible protection of the information provider as well as the person concerned.

Measures in the supply chain

By taking preventive measures, we promote compliance with regulations in our organisation and raise the awareness of our employees. This is why information and employee training plays a key role in compliance work across all hierarchy levels. All employees joining Volkswagen AG are obliged to complete an online tutorial about the Group’s Code of Conduct. The topic of human rights forms an intrinsic part of this training course. In addition, employees are able to access other online and print communication offerings to obtain further information about the Code of Conduct.
Risk analysis
As part of the established risk management processes, risk assessments on the subject of human rights are also carried out by the Group's key divisions and companies, including the countermeasures taken. The results of the risk assessment are in the establishment of the annual compliance program.

Sustainability requirements for our suppliers³
The “Sustainability in supplier relations” concept is based on the “Volkswagen Group requirements regarding sustainability in its relationships with business partners (Code of Conduct for Business Partners)”. This formulates the Volkswagen Group’s expectations for our business partners’ conduct with respect to key environmental, social and compliance standards. Internationally acknowledged human rights are included in these standards. Our goal is to ensure compliance with our sustainability standards along the entire global supply chain by integrating them into the procurement process on a contractual level. The requirements are based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the International Chamber of Commerce’s Business Charter for Sustainable Development, and the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organisation. Our suppliers must acknowledge our sustainability requirements before submitting a quotation, and are required to update this acknowledgement every 12 months. Our “Sustainability in supplier relations” concept rests on three pillars: requirements, monitoring and development. We apply these three benchmarks to the ongoing assessment and improvement of our suppliers’ sustainability performance.

Training and monitoring of suppliers

Risk analysis

To facilitate ongoing supplier development, in the course of our business relations we make an electronic learning (e-learning) module on sustainability available to all suppliers. Alongside the e-learning format, we also conduct topic-specific sustainability training courses and workshops with our suppliers at selected locations. We use various tools to test the suppliers’ compliance with our sustainability requirements, including a self-assessment questionnaire (in alignment with other European based OEMs), inclusion of sustainability as part of supplier quality audits, and the performance of supplier audits focusing on sustainability.

The Volkswagen Group uses country-specific risk analysis to get an assessment of any social or ecological risks or risks related to human rights at the respective contractor locations even before negotiations with potential contractors begin. The analysis incorporates data from third parties as well as internal experience. On this basis, countries such as Brazil, India, China, Mexico and Russia have been identified as being exposed to an increased risk of non-compliance with our sustainability requirements. In contractor development, we therefore place special focus on these countries. To identify current developments as well as long-term structural challenges in each country, we rely on the ongoing exchange of information between the brands and the regions at the regular meetings and videoconferences held by the sustainability procurement network.

Before entering into a business relationship, we also check the integrity of our business partners (Business Partner Check) in a risk-oriented manner.

Outlook
In pursuit of ongoing improvements to its sustainability management activities, the Volkswagen Group set up a Sustainability Council in 2016. Made up of prominent international experts from politics, science and public life, the Sustainability Council communicates with the Board of Management, top management and employee representatives on a regular basis and provides unbiased advice on sustainability issues. The Sustainability Council is free to define its own procedures and set its own priorities. Alongside sustainable mobility, climate protection, the future of work, and digitisation, the Council also deals with questions of social responsibility and integrity.
To incorporate further insights into human rights issues and the opinions of independent external experts in our corporate strategy, we organise regular stakeholder dialogues attended by representatives from NGOs, science and politics.
Our company will show the same intolerance towards human rights violations in the future as well. Because we regard such violations as a dynamic risk, we will align our monitoring procedures with ongoing developments and continue to raise awareness of forms of modern slavery and human trafficking both inside and outside the company. One such measure will be to refine our Code of Conduct for Business Partners by adding modern slavery and human trafficking as examples of human rights’ abuses.

Year ended 28th May 2016

Our Commitment

The human rights of all people working directly or indirectly for FatFace is of the utmost importance to us. Any human rights abuses have no place in our business or in the world in which we live. We are committed to ensuring that FatFace has a robust approach to addressing Modern Slavery and human rights abuses within our supply chains. The implementation of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 highlights the importance of finding collaborative solutions to address these issues. We will be tracking a number of key performance indicators to ensure that we continue to conduct appropriate supply chain due diligence and I look forward to reporting our progress against these year on year:

-

Maintaining a declaration of commitment from our suppliers

-

Closely monitoring non-compliance with our supply chain code of conduct

-

Monitoring risk beyond our first tier suppliers

-

Maintaining procurement staff training levels

-

Sustaining an appropriate corporate governance structure

-

Tracking the number of cases of Modern Slavery reported

CEO FATFACE JULY 2016

Overview
Our business
Founded in 1988, FatFace is a UK lifestyle clothing brand with over 200 retail stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland and 3 in the US. The Group offers a wide range of high quality and affordable clothing, footwear and accessories to its target demographic, which is primarily family oriented women and men who are attracted by an active and casual outdoor lifestyle.
Our Vision - ‘Absolutely everything we do is designed to be loved by all our customers for life outside 9-5’
Our Structure – In line with our values, we have developed a robust approach to sustainability which is a core part of our business strategy and includes a clear reporting structure. Our Modern Slavery Act 2015 responsibilities sit with our sustainability team which is led by a member of the FatFace board of directors. We report our Modern Slavery responsibilities as part of our sustainability KPIs through the group board audit committee, regularly reviewing progress.
Our core product supply chain
FatFace sources clothing, footwear and accessories from over 160 trusted and well integrated manufacturing partners across 14 countries globally. Our sourcing mix reflects the requirements and core principles of the FatFace brand, which prides itself on producing great quality.
Since selling our first t-shirt in 1988, FatFace has built particularly strong relationships with our core product manufacturing partners with our top 10 each having worked with FatFace for 8 years or more and our top 20 suppliers having a combined 162 year relationship with FatFace and accounting for 81% of our product intake by value (2015). The FatFace product mix and our ability to ensure continued quality is dependent on working with these established manufacturing partners that fully understand our business values and expectations. The strength of our relationships provides us with excellent visibility of our first tier factory locations and provides an excellent platform for understanding and addressing Modern Slavery and human trafficking concerns within the supply chain.

How do we define modern slavery
We have derived our definition of Modern Slavery from the UN guiding principles on human rights and as such, for FatFace, ‘Modern Slavery involves one person depriving another of their liberty in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain’.
Our policies in relation to slavery and human trafficking
We recognise that human rights abuses have the potential to exist within global garment supply chains and as a responsible retailer we have the duty to understand and address these issues, working together with key partners and stakeholders in order to create sustainable change. In 2015 we developed and updated our code of conduct, ‘The FatFace Way of Life’ as a way of sharing our values and expectations with our core product suppliers. These expectations are based on universally recognised standards such as the ETI Base Code and UN guiding principles on human rights.
Understanding our risks
Throughout the past year we have mapped our supply chains and identified that our core product supply chain is most at risk from exposure to human rights abuses. Garment supply chains are long and complex, with a large number of actors involved between the productions of the raw material through to the product arriving in our stores. The large majority of these stages are out of our direct control, particularly from the 2nd tier of our supply chain downward. As a result, we have identified this as an area of risk. In order to fully understand our exposure to human right abuses within our supply chain we have mapped our core product supply chain against country specific risks highlighted by the Global Slavery Index. As a result of this, India, China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Turkey and Pakistan represent first tier sourcing countries with the highest likelihood of modern slavery risk. India represents many different stages of garment sourcing, including cotton production, ginning, spinning and garment manufacturing and challenges such as forced labour represent a risk.
We also recognise that human rights abuses can exist within our non-product supply chains. We have identified recruitment and the utilisation of contract labour within our own business as an area of potential risk and have policies in place accordingly to mitigate these risks.
“we have mapped our core product supply chain against country specific risks highlighted by the Global Slavery Index.”

Assessing our supply chain
In order to fully understand our supply chain risks we regularly review the performance of our core product manufacturing partners against our Code of Conduct and we are members of the collaborative SEDEX platform that enables us to analyse 3rd party audit assessments. In addition, we also conduct verification assessments of our key sourcing partners. In 2015-2016, 85% of our manufacturing partners had signed our code of conduct and 89% had undergone an audit or assessment in the past 12 months and 27% had undergone a FatFace specific verification assessment.
During the year, we launched a dedicated email account for manufacturing partners to share information confidentially with FatFace and conducted a workshop involving all 35 of our Indian suppliers outlining our code of conduct and human rights expectations.
“we regularly review the performance of our manufacturing partners”
How is modern slavery reported
We analyse human rights abuses and non-compliance against our code of conduct through the implementation of FatFace’s audit and assessment process. This information is shared on a monthly basis to the strategic leadership team and reported as part of our governance structure to the group board of directors through the quarterly audit committee.
Our membership of the Ethical Trading Initiative provides FatFace with an important collaborative platform that enables the sharing and dissemination of information relating to human rights abuses amongst industry peers and provides leading insight into how best to address these challenges. FatFace’s involvement in the Ethical Training Initiative approach to addressing the issue of Syrian refugee exploitation in the informal Turkish garment industry is an example of such collaboration.
We have developed a dedicated email address for suppliers to communicate concerns they may have about human rights abuses in our supply chain and furthermore, we have been piloting anonymous smartphone app surveys involving garment workers in our Chinese supply chain.

Training and capacity building
All FatFace core product procurement staff undergo training outlining the principles of our code of conduct and the implications that human rights abuses can have upon our supply chain operations and the people within them. We also hold supplier workshops in key risk countries regarding the implementation of relevant legislation including the expectations of our code of conduct and what this means for FatFace and our manufacturing partners.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Crown Agents supports the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015) and endeavours to ensure that slavery
and human trafficking are not taking place in any of its supply chains or any parts of its own
business. We have also partnered with Stronger Together, a multi-stakeholder initiative aiming to
reduce modern slavery.
To ensure compliance with the Act, we have assessed the following:
(a) Our organisational structure, business and supply chains;
Crown Agents works with leaders to accelerate self-sufficiency and prosperity. We offer supply
chain, fund management, programme design, delivery and evaluation, training, institutional
efficiency and revenue generation expertise. We do this across health, humanitarian, stabilisation,
governance and public administration, prosperity and renewable energy, from Ukraine to Nigeria,
Sierra Leone to Bangladesh and Nepal to Iraq. We are a registered social enterprise, 100% owned
by the Crown Agents Foundation.
Throughout our supply chain services, we help our clients adopt a strategic sourcing approach.
We manage the entire supply chain process from expediting, to customs clearance and last mile
logistics. We deliver a diverse range of items, from medical equipment and drugs, to vehicles,
telecommunications equipment and solar panels.
(b) Our policies in relation to slavery and human trafficking;
Our Human Resources' Policy ""Tackling Modern Slavery in Business and Supply Chains"" enables
the integration of Modern Slavery issues into all relevant business systems including our Global
Code of Conduct, Ethical Policy, Reporting and Whistleblowing Policy and Child Protection Policy.
(c) Our due diligence processes in relation to slavery and human trafficking in our business
and supply chains;
Our specialist Compliance Unit works closely with project teams to implement key ethical policies
and processes, including internationally recognised, end-to-end standards throughout the supply
chain. Crown Agents has a well-established due diligence process which enables us to make and
objective, informed and transparent decisions about whether to associate with a business partner
or not. We have updated these processes to cover risks related to slavery and trafficking.
We request all our suppliers and business partners to complete Business Partner Questionnaire.
This document invites them to disclose any history or involvement in Modern Slavery, be it media
allegations, pending litigation or current court proceedings. Our due diligence process requires all
of Crown Agents Group companies, directors, officers and employees to adhere to the standards
of our Ethical Code of Conduct for Business Partners. Our contract templates also refer to the UK
Modern Slavery Act.

(d) The parts of our business and supply chains where there is a risk of slavery and human
trafficking taking place, and the steps we have taken to assess and manage that risk;
Crown Agents recognises that our Supply Chains Services operate in high-risk environments. We
therefore need to ensure that the goods we are supplying to our clients are slavery-free. We also
ensure that the external consultants we hire are not recruited through exploitative agencies.
Similarly, we acknowledge that service providers, such as cleaners, security staff and drivers in
our UK and International Offices can be at risk of labour exploitation.
We have developed a ""Modern Slavery"" checklist for staff undertaking supplier visits. We
increasingly consider forced labour and human trafficking into account on our risk registers.
Our Compliance team works closely with our Human Resources Department to ensure that best
practices in recruitment are implemented across the board, using Stronger Together
implementation guidelines.
(e) Our effectiveness in ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in
our business or supply chains, measured against such performance indicators as we
consider appropriate;
Our reporting and whistleblowing system relies on an ""Ethical Line"" hot-line (or TEL), where
individuals can report any unethical behaviour in relation to Crown Agents' businesses or
operations anywhere in the world or a breach of Crown Agents' policies. Our Modern Slavery Policy
specifically encourages individuals to use TEL to raise concerns regarding slavery and human
trafficking. Crown Agents' Compliance Team also manages a dedicated email address through
which complaints or concerns can be raised directly. All correspondence is dealt with in the strictest
of confidence.
(f) The training about slavery and human trafficking available to our staff
As part of Crown Agents' onboarding program, all our new starters at Crown Agents are required
to complete an online Module on Modern Slavery within the first three months of their contract.
Our Senior Compliance Officer attended a mandatory training course run by Stronger Together -
""Tackling Modern Slavery in the Supply Chain"" and acts as a focal point for queries related to
Modern Slavery. Our Compliance Team regularly attends relevant external events in the UK and
abroad, including the OECD Forum on Responsible Business Conduct in Paris and the United
Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights in Geneva.
In addition, awareness-raising sessions regarding Modern Slavery have been integrated into
standard compliance training and capacity building. Crown Agents' Group Compliance Team holds
sessions on Modern Slavery during all country visits. This has recently included trainings in
Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Singapore, South Sudan, Turkey and
Zimbabwe. Similar awareness sessions are regularly arranged for our UK Headquarters Staff.
Our company intranet has a page devoted on the topic of Modern Slavery, which includes; links to
the Modern Slavery Act, the Home Office Guidance, the Stronger Together and other useful
resources on Modern Slavery in the UK and worldwide. This has been widely circulated across the
business.

199,"DECLARATION ON MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
This declaration is published in compliance with Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, which was enacted to combat slavery and human trafficking.
It describes the measures that Crédit AgricoleS.A. implemented in 2018 to prevent the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in its business activities and relationships with its suppliers.
This declaration was approved by Crédit Agricole S.A.’s Board of Directors at its meeting of 21 May 2019.
OUR GROUP, OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
The Crédit Agricole Group has banking and insurance activities in 47 countries, 51 million clients across the world, 10.1 million members and almost 900,000 individual shareholders. The Group has 141,000 employees in France and abroad. Our compliance with social and environmental commitments is an integral part of the investment and business transformation projects of our clients, which include multi-national groups, SMEs, farmers, tradespeople, NGOs, communities and consumers.
In the course of its business activities, the Crédit Agricole Group purchases products and services from suppliers, who themselves may use subcontractors. In 2018, our purchases totalled €6.9 billion, most of which were for products and services in the following categories: real estate, IT, intellectual services, general goods and services, and communication.
OUR COMMITMENTS
Our main commitments have their roots in the fundamental principles we adhere to, which are:
 The United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of 1948  The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact, since 2003  The Equator Principles, since 2003  The Principles for Responsible Investment, since 2006  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, since 2015  The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises  The International Labour Organisation conventions and the performance standards of Société
Financière Internationale (SFI).
These commitments are set forth in the following policies which formally specify the principles of professional, social and environmental ethics to be observed throughout our Group, including in respect of human rights:
- CSR sector financing policies, which set forth the social and environmental criteria that apply to lending and investment activities and which include respect for human rights. For each sector covered, a reference framework is determined and analytical criteria are defined for evaluating transactions and for detecting projects and transactions in which the Group does not wish to be involved.
- The Diversity Charter, which since 2008 has underpinned the Crédit Agricole Group’s efforts to promote diversity in the workplace and prevent all forms of discrimination.
- The Human Rights Charter, adopted in 2009, which commits all Crédit Agricole S.A. entities to ensure that they and their suppliers comply with the principles and fundamental rights of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, which deal specifically with the issues of forced labour, child labour, discrimination and freedom of association.
- The Responsible Purchasing Policy and the Responsible Purchasing Charter, which were revised in 2017 and extended to the entire Crédit Agricole Group in 2018. This policy and charter require

reciprocal commitments from the Crédit Agricole Group and its suppliers that are based on the fundamental principles of the UN Global Compact.
- The Crédit Agricole Group Ethics Charter, which was first issued in May 2017, and which clearly states that the Group's operational and behavioural principles comply with international laws and regulations on the protection of human rights and on the prevention of forced labour, child labour and corruption.
- The Code of Conduct, which each Crédit Agricole S.A. Group entity must prepare to implement the principles of the Group's Ethics Charter. The Crédit Agricole S.A. Code of Conduct was disseminated in September 2018, after being approved by the Board of Directors on 14 May 2018 and being presented to employee representative bodies in June 2018.
All of the above documents are available on our website1.
The procedures that Crédit Agricole S.A. has implemented or is putting into place include, but are not limited to the following:
 Procedures for our employees
We make sure that all of Crédit Agricole S.A.’s internal HR procedures are consistent with the commitments described above. As a signatory of the Diversity Charter, we have asserted our commitment to promote cultural, ethical and social diversity in the workplace and our determination to prevent discrimination. Furthermore, the Group's Ethics Charter specifies the behaviour that is expected of all employees. The Crédit Agricole S.A.’s Code of Conduct reminds employees that they must strictly observe the rules that govern professional ethics and the respect for human rights and fundamental labour rights, both in their relationships with other employees and with all other parties.
A body of compliance procedures has been distributed and is regularly updated. This includes a specific procedure for reporting non-compliance. Whenever employees observe an instance of non-compliance, they have an obligation to inform their supervisor, who in turn must inform the Compliance function.
There is also a whistle-blowing mechanism that is available to all Crédit Agricole Group employees, external and occasional staff, and contractors and suppliers with which the Group has an established business relationship. This enables these people to report any failure to comply with the Group's ethics, policies or procedures directly to the entity's Compliance officer and without informing their supervisor. In accordance with regulations, the whistle blower's identity is kept confidential. To assist employees who wish to exercise their whistle-blowing right, the Crédit Agricole Group is deploying a new IT platform for reporting compliance alerts that ensures the strict confidentiality of the whistle-blower's identity, of the information reported, of the person or people involved, and of the information exchanged between the whistle-blower and the person who processes the information. This tool will be progressively deployed throughout the Crédit Agricole Group in the first half of 2019.
 Procedures for our suppliers
To detect and prevent the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking within or in connection with our supply chain, we have implemented procedures to: • Identify and assess the most risk-exposed sectors of our supply chain • Monitor these sectors • Prevent the risks of modern slavery practices within our procurement process.
The Crédit Agricole Group’s Responsible Purchasing Policy has been signed by the chief executive officers of each Group entity, who are thus committed to complying with its principles within the scope of their responsibilities. This policy applies to employees who are involved in the purchasing process and to suppliers. The rules that apply to purchasing are also explained in a procedural memo that was updated in 2019 and which applies to all employees. In 2018, Crédit Agricole S.A. was once again

awarded Responsible Purchasing and Supplier Relations certification from the Ombudsman of the French Republic and the National Purchasing Council, and this certification was extended to all of the Group's subsidiaries for the first time.
Our suppliers' agreement to observe our values is formally expressed in the Responsible Purchasing Charter, which they must sign before responding to a request for proposals or signing a supplier contract. This charter sets forth the reciprocal commitments of the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group and its suppliers, which are based on the fundamental principles of the UN Global Compact. Furthermore, all contract templates include a specific clause on ""Respect for human rights, protection of the environment and the prevention of corruption”, by which suppliers represent and warrant that they ensure compliance within their supply chains with all of their obligations in respect of the identification of risks and the prevention of serious breaches of human rights and fundamental liberties, or of serious harm to the health or safety of people or to the environment which may result from their activities, in accordance with the laws and/or regulations in the areas of human, social and environmental rights. For the United Kingdom, this clause refers expressly to the Act of 26 March 2015 on the prevention of all forms of modern slavery and human trafficking.
The analysis of CSR purchasing risks is based on three complementary approaches, which include an assessment of the risk that is specific to each category of purchases, an analysis of the supplier risk, and an analysis of the geographic risk, which may negatively impact the overall rating. In 2017, the Group Purchasing Department worked with three leading banking groups and the French standards body AFNOR to remap the CSR risks that are intrinsic to each purchasing category. In 2018, the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group used the findings of this work to identify, analyse and prioritise the riskiest categories of purchases on the basis of environmental, social, human rights, ethical and supply-chain criteria.
For the categories of purchases that require supplier approval by the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group, the CSR supplier assessment form is systematically attached to all requests for proposals. This assessment covers their CSR management system and offering, and includes human rights criteria. Since 2012, this assessment has been entrusted to EcoVadis, an independent company whose contract was renewed in 2018. It is used to obtain an overall CSR rating, which accounts for at least 10% of the supplier purchase decision.
Based on one analysis of gross risk, three categories of purchases identified as high or very high risk in our mapping have been worked on through an action plan to reduce the risks, namely the construction, IT equipment and advertising objects categories. These action plans will be deployed in 2019 to reduce the net CSR risk of suppliers for these categories.
Lastly, Crédit Agricole S.A. provides funding to Human Resources Without Borders, an international NGO that promotes and defends human rights at work. Human Resources Without Borders provides its contributors with forced labour and child labour risk maps for each geographic region, which are an additional source of information we use to update our purchasing risk map.
AWARENESS-RAISING AND TRAINING A Purchasing Responsibly e-learning module has been made available to the Crédit Agricole S.A. Group’s purchasing staff, to inform them of the various risks involved and the measures that have been implemented, and enable them to comply with their employer's procedures and policies. This module, which is included in the employee training catalogue, is also accessible to all Crédit Agricole S.A. Group employees. This ensures that any employee who may potentially be involved in a purchasing transaction is able to be informed of and comply with the Responsible Purchasing Policy, which includes the prevention of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking within our supply chain and within our company.
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT The Crédit Agricole S.A. Group intends to incorporate its efforts to prevent modern slavery within its overall strategy for achieving sustainable performance and which is based on operational and behavioural principles that are consistent with the values it defends. Accordingly, all efforts to prevent the risks of human rights breaches are developed in accordance with the measures of the 2018 Vigilance Plan, which was prepared within the framework of the French Act of 27 March 2017 on the Duty of Care
3

of Parent Companies and Companies that Contract for Goods and Services, and with the various measures of the ‘Sapin 2 Act’ of 9 December 2016 on Transparency, the Prevention of Corruption and the Modernisation of the Economy. These efforts are part of a continuous improvement process, the main components of which are: - Improving risk identification and management tools, while updating risk maps when necessary and
deploying targeted action plans to reduce the CSR risk of suppliers in the purchasing categories identified as ‘high risk’ and ‘very high risk - Including our suppliers in our efforts, by regularly informing them of our responsible purchasing commitments and strategy - Making our whistle-blowing procedure more easily available to our external and occasional staff, and to our contractors and suppliers with which we have an established business relationship, by enabling them to access the IT platform we are currently deploying.

1. INTRODUCTION FROM RICHARD PECK, MANAGING DIRECTOR
The UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA) is designed to tackle slavery and for organisations to ensure that modern slavery does not take place within their businesses. The MSA also requires commercial organisations which carry on a business, or part of a business, in the UK and which have a global turnover above £36 million to publish a slavery and human trafficking statement each financial year, setting out the steps taken to ensure there is no slavery or human trafficking in their business or supply chains. We are proud of the steps we have taken to combat slavery and human trafficking. We are committed to protecting the mental and physical well-being of our people, pursuing a balance between work demands and personal requirements and by forbidding behaviour that is physically or emotionally harmful to any individual. Our suppliers are carefully selected in a fair and transparent manner, guided by criteria of fair competition, impartiality, compliance with laws, equity in pricing and quality of goods and/or services. This statement sets out our policies and practices on behalf of Luxottica Retail UK Limited in respect of our ethical business practices and ethos, the steps we have taken in the financial year ended 31 December 2017 and the Code of Ethics we adhere to as part of the Luxottica Group of companies.

201,"CA Transparency in Supply Chain and UK Modern Slavery Statement
PVH Corp. Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement Under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and UK Modern Slavery Act
This Statement provides an overview of the efforts that PVH Corp. (together with its subsidiaries, “PVH,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) has taken, including during our fiscal year that ended on January 29, 2017, to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business or our supply chain. We have prepared this Statement on a consolidated basis for PVH, although not all of the entities in our consolidated group are subject to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act or the UK Modern Slavery Act, because we have a common compliance program and common policies relating to slavery and human trafficking across the Company.
Company Overview
PVH has excelled at growing brands and businesses with rich American heritages, becoming one of the largest apparel companies in the world. We have over 30,000 associates operating in over 40 countries with over $8 billion in annual revenues. We own the iconic CALVIN KLEIN, TOMMY HILFIGER, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Speedo(1), Warner’s, Olga and True&Co. brands and market a variety of goods under these and other nationally and internationally known owned and licensed brands.
We are committed to upholding the highest moral, ethical and legal standards in all aspects of our business and across our supply chain, and to making a true impact on the people, the environment and the communities where we work and live. As part of this commitment, Corporate Responsibility (CR) is central to how we conduct business. Please visit www.PVH.com/Responsibility to read about our CR program and efforts, as well as for links to our 2016 and prior years’ Annual CR Reports.
Alignment with International Standards; Policies
The requirements for doing business with PVH are based, in part, on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Core Conventions and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We are also a founding member of the Fair Labor Association (“FLA”) on whose Board one of our CR executives sits. We have committed to the FLA’s ten Principles of Fair Labor and Responsible Sourcing and Production and have agreed to uphold the FLA Workplace Code of Conduct in our supply chain.
We communicate our standards and requirements to our business partners in our supply chain through the following:
A Shared Commitment, our code of conduct for all of our business partners, a copy of which is provided to each of them at the outset of our relationship. First introduced in 1991, A Shared Commitment, prohibits forced and involuntary labor, whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise. In addition, A Shared Commitment states that mental and physical coercion, slavery and human trafficking are prohibited in our supply chain.
Our Supplier Guidelines, which are provided to both licensees and suppliers during our onboarding process. The Supplier Guidelines mandate that workers cannot be held responsible for fees paid to agencies or the factory in exchange for employment.
Our Branded Merchandise Policy requires suppliers and licensees to certify affirmatively that materials used in the manufacture of our products are free from the use of slave labor and human trafficking.
Each of the above has been translated into the key languages of our business partners so that they can clearly understand what is required to establish and maintain a relationship with PVH.
Verification of Product Supply Chain to Evaluate, Monitor and Address Risks of Human Trafficking
We evaluate, monitor and address the risks of slavery and human trafficking in our industry and supply chain in several ways.
Evaluation
We participate in multi-stakeholder initiatives that help us to evaluate and address slavery and human trafficking risks in our industry and supply chain. PVH is a member of several industry associations and programs that are dedicated to protecting workers’ rights, including the prevention of modern slavery and human trafficking, such as the American Apparel & Footwear Association, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, the United States Council for International Business, Better Work, and the FLA (including with respect to its initiative to better understand and prevent child labor in Turkey’s cotton industry). Additionally, PVH has signed a multi-stakeholder letter to the governments of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan conveying concern over forced labor issues in those countries.
We also consult third party resources and databases, engage in other research, utilize consultants and engage with members of civil society to evaluate slavery and human trafficking risk. PVH provides for transparency through reporting, survey responses, meetings with stakeholders and

other means.
Monitoring/Addressing Risks
We continually monitor compliance with all of our CR requirements, including the prohibition against forced or involuntary labor, and address any identified risks or violations. We conduct pre-sourcing assessments before a factory is allowed to produce PVH product, conduct regular audits once production begins, work closely with factories to remediate any identified deficiencies and, when necessary, terminate supplier factories that fail to comply with our policies, procedures or guidelines.
Factory Audits: Audits are typically conducted by reputable third party auditors or, to a lesser extent, by members of our CR team, every six to 24 months. Several factors, including the results of the previous audit, will dictate the actual frequency. Audits are usually scheduled in advance with the suppliers in order to foster a relationship of trust and cooperation but unannounced audits are conducted as necessary.
Audits are guided by a CR Assessment Tool that measures compliance through metrics based on the requirements of A Shared Commitment, including specific metrics tied to forced labor. The CR Assessment Tool drives greater objectivity and consistency in our assessment program by ensuring that all suppliers producing PVH product are evaluated based on consistent criteria. As part of the audit, we also seek workers’ views in confidence, so that we can hear, first hand, about factory conditions.
PVH’s audit program encourages our business partners to assume greater responsibility for their labor practices and general compliance by providing the opportunity for suppliers to remediate any identified issues. We also reward those business partners that adopt and implement our standards and policies with continued business.
Remediation: We believe that remediation best serves the interests of workers by enabling the supplier to develop safe, compliant and respectful workplaces. Therefore, if an audit reveals that a factory has failed to comply with our standards, policies or other requirements, we typically work with the factory to remediate the issues. We engage factory managers in an open discussion on the findings, exploring root causes, and support them in developing corrective action plans (“CAPs”). In addition, we meet with our suppliers between audits to review their progress in implementing remediation activities and to provide further guidance.
Termination: We will generally terminate a relationship with a supplier or factory if (i) it fails to successfully remediate issues uncovered by an audit or (ii) we identify what we would consider an egregious violation of our policies or guidelines and remediation is not appropriate or feasible.
Certifications: At the beginning or renewal of a relationship, suppliers are required to acknowledge A Shared Commitment and agree to implement its requirements. PVH also requires under its Branded Merchandise Policy that direct suppliers and licensees certify that materials incorporated into PVH products, whether acquired directly or indirectly, are from a source that does not use forced or involuntary labor and is not involved in human trafficking.
Internal Accountability & Training
Our commitment to upholding the high standards that we require for our Company and business partners is reinforced at the most senior levels of PVH. Our Board of Directors has a Corporate Responsibility Committee that is responsible for advising our Board and management on policies and strategies that affect the Company's role as a socially responsible organization.
All associates are required to undergo compliance and ethics training, including the review and certification of our core policies, upon hire and annually thereafter. The Company may take disciplinary action against any associate who violates any of our policies, guidelines or otherwise fails to uphold our high moral, legal or ethical standards.
PVH provides management and associates who have direct responsibility for supply chain processes with targeted training on slavery and human trafficking, including on how to identify and mitigate risks. In addition, members of our CR team and other PVH associates attend external training programs and seminars on social compliance issues, including slavery and human trafficking.
We have a reporting hotline for associates, which is being extended to factory workers, so that they may report potential legal, regulatory, or policy violations and other ethical concerns. Grievances can be made anonymously and confidentially to the extent allowed under applicable law.
As an external verification of our CR program, we submit to the FLA accreditation standard, which incorporates an independent evaluation of each member's “systems and procedures required for successfully upholding fair labor standards throughout brands’ supply chains.” We have continuously maintained our accreditation since 2005.
External Training
We conduct targeted training for suppliers that may have an increased risk of slavery or human trafficking. Our CR team and other PVH associates also participate as speakers in other external training programs and seminars on slavery and human trafficking to increase awareness and encourage the adoption of best practices to address these issues.

All relevant employees dealing with suppliers will be required to familiarise themselves with the M&B Supplier Code of Conduct.
A copy of the M&B Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Policy will be available to employees.
M&B will seek to review the M&B Supplier Code of Conduct and M&B Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Policy each year, and any updates will be notified accordingly to all relevant employees and suppliers (as appropriate).
When formally adopted by the Board of M&B, this Statement will be published on M&B's corporate website. Any updates or revisions to this Statement shall, when formally approved by M&B, be published on M&B's corporate website.
7. Effectiveness
We will be reviewing the following key performance indicators to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business and supply chain:
Records to confirm all employees have the right to work in the UK; Records to confirm that key relevant employees have received appropriate training; Actions taken to strengthen supply chain due diligence, auditing and verification; and Records to confirm that suppliers have self-certified compliance with the M&B Supplier Code of Conduct and the fundamental ethical principles within it.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

What We are Doing

Introduction to our structure, business and supply chains
The JD Sports Fashion Group (“JD”) is a global retailer and wholesaler of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for casual fashion, sports and outdoor activities offering a range of globally and nationally recognised third party branded merchandise and JD sourced private and licensed labels.
We operate from around 1300 stores in most of Western Europe as well as Malaysia and Australia. The biggest part of the JD business comprises the retail of product supplied by globally recognised third party brands . The brands are aware of their obligations to source ethically and in accordance with the principles at the heart of the Modern Slavery Act and we monitor the modern slavery statements of our key brands.
The JD sourced private label business accounts for around 12% of our sales, but we have over the last ten years increased our commitment to ensuring that all our suppliers operate in line with our ethical standards. JD recognise that it is important to continually strive to improve our relationships and how we work with our global partners and suppliers. These relationships and core values are vital in tackling modern slavery.

What We are Doing

Modern slavery all around us

“It is walking our streets, supplying shops and supermarkets, working in fields, factories or nail bars, trapped in brothels or cowering behind the curtains in an ordinary street : slavery. Something most of us thought consigned to history books, belonging to a different century, is a shameful and shocking presence in modern Britain.”
The Right Honourable Theresa May, Home Secretary, November 2013
Our policies in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking
We believe it is important to understand what modern slaves are in the world today. JD has a policy of trading ethically wherever possible. Modern slavery takes many forms: Human trafficking, forced labour, debt bondage, child labour and prostitution. Modern slavery involves criminal activity and the signs are often subtle and difficult to identify.

Our overall ethical policy begins with our Board and our sourcing, quality and ethics team has operational responsibility for implementing it.

Over the past months we have been working with our staff and suppliers to create awareness. May 2017 saw the development of a bespoke modern slavery training programme focusing on recognising potential risks within our supply chain and actions to take to avoid and eradicate modern slavery. During May and June 120 key staff will have attended an off site conference which we believe will create the awareness and skills to embed these policies into their everyday lives and job roles.

The modern slavery training programme has been adapted to sit on our E-learning platform and will form a mandatory part of the induction of all employees. In addition, our current in-house whistle blowing facility has been updated to allow confidential reporting on modern slavery by our employees, including store and agency staff.

JD Sports Fashion PLC and its Supply Chain

What We are Doing

Our due diligence processes
Within our business we contract fully factored garments and footwear to first tier suppliers and it is therefore an important factor for us as we strive to better understand and manage our complex supply chain.
JD is working towards identifying its second tier suppliers and will work to instil our values and commitment throughout the supply chain. It is important for us to admit that modern slavery is a hidden issue, accept that it is difficult to find with today’s complex supply chains but recognise the importance of creating a sense of awareness and responsibility in our own employees and those of our direct suppliers. We will collaborate together to help eradicate the very real risks in the modern world.
There are numerous obstacles to overcome, particularly in countries where local laws are insufficient to protect workers. Those countries with high proportions of migrant workers are especially at risk. Close to nineteen million of the world’s forced labourers are exploited by private enterprise.
We believe it is important to recognise this as a business and welcome the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Supply chains are increasingly complex and responsibilities for company supply chains can be impossible to own. The JD Supply Chain is no different and we are committed to developing policies and strategies to combat the suffering of today’s slaves.
Although it happens everywhere, some regions have a higher prevalence of slavery and forced labour but developing our understanding of our supply chain will enable us to work towards appropriate action. No sector can remain immune and no sector can be considered to be untainted.

What We are Doing

Our effectiveness in managing modern slavery risks
JD Sports Code of Conduct is embedded into its business practices. Over the past seven years, JD has ensured that all suppliers of its own brand apparel and footwear are aware of the JD Code of Conduct. This code of conduct is based on the ETI Base Code and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work in line with the ILO Convention 29. The adoption of this code, sets the standards we require from our manufacturers of own branded product. This Code of Conduct is explained and documented within our terms and conditions of supply which is at the core of all contracts with our overseas agents and suppliers.

JD takes its responsibilities towards the workers in our own operations as well as those within our supply chain very seriously. JD employs 25,830 people directly in the UK, Europe and Asia with the majority in retail.
The JD business is growing and is becoming increasingly diverse. Therefore a key focus for us is ensuring that our wider group is aware of our policies and processes and adopts them, as our core business does.
JD are currently working to ensure that our policies with our suppliers and service providers are reviewed to ensure compliance with our commitment to the Modern Slavery Act and its principles.

What We are Doing

JD has mapped and monitored all of its first tier suppliers during 2015 and 2016 to ensure full visibility of its supply base. Many of our smaller subsidiaries are already advanced in this process and we are constantly striving to bring new acquisitions up to our standards. We plan to encompass all our companies within the group during the next 12 months in the same programme.
Supply chain compliance is managed centrally and training of this team and those working in the procurement of orders are involved in an established sourcing strategy to maintain and manage our control of our diverse supply base. Understanding the “Red Flags” of modern slavery and the underlying causes forms part of their annual objectives . Over the coming months, awareness training to the wider personnel will build on the importance of understanding how businesses and individuals can work to eradicate modern slavery, not only in the work place but in every day life.
JD takes steps to ensure the due diligence of its suppliers and to avoid subcontracting to unauthorised units. Un-disclosed sub-contracting is expressly prohibited and would be considered a breach of our Code of Conduct and Terms and Conditions of Supply.
Containers are placed only at authorised factory sites and tracked by our freight partners from factory to port of export.
Security labels are an integral part of the manufacture of our products. These labels are only delivered to the contracted factory detailed on our Purchase order.

What We are Doing

Regular visits are undertaken by JD’s head office to factories and we recognise that strong close relationships with our partners are essential to build mutual values and combined strategies to improve conditions for workers and to eliminate abuse of human rights.
90% of JD’s second tier suppliers have been defined and mapped during the first part of 2017 . This has increased the scope of the visibility of our supply chain to the mills that produce our fabrics, the dye houses that process the fabric further and finally the print houses and embroidery houses that embellish our product.
Whilst we do not currently have direct relationships with these suppliers, traceability of these suppliers is an important first step.
We hope that building this relationship down the supply chain will embed our policies and standards further. Manufacturing supply chains are complex and difficult to control, involving many stages and components. It is important that our business is aware of the risks and that we take steps to manage these indirect suppliers.

What We are Doing

JD’s commitment to ethical trade and the eradication of modern slavery in our supply chain is led at Board level and this modern slavery report has been approved by the JD Board. The JD Board will review this modern slavery report at least once a year. JD will continually monitor its progress and will report on this annually. Below is a summary of the processes and actions currently undertaken.
Risk assessments
All of our first tier suppliers must complete a comprehensive self assessment Risk Assessment prior to inclusion in the JD own label source base. This risk assessment is verified by the JD compliance team and may involve further investigation to ensure adherence to at least JD’s minimum standards and compliance with local laws. Suppliers are then graded to allow focus on raising standards and improving practice. Purchase orders are contracted to the agent and the factory selected and policies are issued to both parties.
Factory audits
A pre-determined level of spend after one season will then determine the requirement for a 3rd party ethical audit which includes a corrective action plan. (CAP). We carry out full analysis of the CAP and address the open issues stated in the plan in order to continue the relationship. We understand and appreciate the costs and work involved in preparing and maintaining standards to achieve a successful audit so JD joined the FFC (Fair Factories Clearing House) in 2016 which allows the sharing of audits and CAPs to minimise repeated costs and actions on factories. 77% of our first tier suppliers within the Group are coded Green which shows successful compliance with our principles and strategies.

JD Sports Fashion PLC and its Supply Chain

What We are Doing

Understanding risk & modern slavery training
We have developed a modern slavery training course and E Learning tool. The JD Board of Directors have attended the training course as we believe it is key that there is a “top down” directive in the business in order that personnel at all levels of our business have an understanding of the risks and develop critical awareness of the undisputed risk of Modern Slavery in our industry. 120 key members of the Group, involved in direct and indirect procurement, have received the same training and this will be extended to the wider workforce via our E-Learning module by the end of the year. It is planned to include our key suppliers to the business by the end of 2018. Awareness training is planned for our employees in our retail stores and warehouses.
Developing supplier relationships
It is always our intention to identify and reward key suppliers that adopt and embed our practices into their own supply chain. We aim to provide consolidation opportunities and a reduced supply base making monitoring of supplier standards easier and more efficient, thus increasing their business opportunities. The mapping of our supply chain is important if we are to identify the risks to those indirectly involved in the manufacturing process and visibility of the 2nd Tier supply base will allow us to develop these relationships further.

Taking action
Our modern slavery training programme has provided vital knowledge to identify risk at an earlier stage in the procurement of our products and we will continue to update our sourcing strategy as we build on this knowledge and expertise. Whilst we are aware of the challenges we face, we are equally committed to resolutions and education in our supply chain where breaches of our policies are found.
It is vital that we work with our suppliers to eradicate modern slavery and recognise that our industry can unknowingly exacerbate Modern Slavery, with the increasing need for speed to market and lower costs. The JD sourcing team works with the buyers to find solutions to this with consolidation and planning. The actions we take will focus on working with high and medium risk suppliers whilst continuing to engage low risk suppliers.
JD teams will continue to undertake regular visits to suppliers, undertaking ethical audits and gain a better understanding of their working practices enabling adoption of our values into their business.

206,"Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Chief Executive’s Introduction
Modern slavery is an unacceptable condition in our current time but one which sadly is still prevalent in the societies in which we live and operate.
Our approach to modern slavery is embedded in our day to day activities through our values, which are listed below:
INTEGRITY - APPLY THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF INTEGRITY IN DEALINGS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS STEWARDSHIP - ACT IN THE LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF THE COMPANIES IN WHICH OUR FUNDS INVEST COMMUNITY - ACT WITH RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE RELATIONSHIPS - CREATE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS FOUNDED ON TRUST AND MUTUAL ADVANTAGE PEOPLE -TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON ANY GROUNDS
Our values are crucial in everything we do. We apply our values equally wherever we operate. They inform our interactions with employees, suppliers and our local communities, as well as the Apax Funds’ investors and portfolio companies. As a result modern slavery and human trafficking are not tolerated in our business activities.
About Apax Our organisation Apax Partners is a leading global Private Equity advisory firm within the asset management sector, focused solely on longterm investment in growth companies. Apax Partners provides investment advice to the Apax Funds.
Founded in 1969 and headquartered in London, Apax Partners operates eight offices in seven countries (UK, US, Brazil, Germany, Israel, India and China), with an experienced team of approximately 100 investment professionals worldwide. Apax Partners' approach is built around its four sector-led teams covering technology and telecommunications, services, healthcare and consumer.
Funds advised by Apax Partners typically invest in large companies with an enterprise value between €1bn and €5bn and the investments made by the Funds generally reflect the sector focused approach and geographic footprint of Apax Partners. The Apax Funds commit capital on behalf of a diverse range of investors, which include public and private pension funds, insurance firms, university endowments and other financial institutions.
Our main policies Employee Awareness and Compliance - Apax Partners’ Ethics and Standards Apax Partners has a detailed set of Global Business Standards (“GBS”) which represent the business standards by which all staff globally are expected to conduct Apax Partners’ business. The purpose of the GBS is to describe how Apax conducts its business and the standards it expects of its staff. The GBS apply to all staff globally, including senior management, employees, contractors and any other staff that represent Apax from time to time.
Apax has a number of offices across the world and each country in which we operate has different rules and requirements that must be reflected within the GBS. Our general approach is to apply the strictest standard and to apply it globally, unless there are good reasons for not doing so. Where there are country specific requirements which cannot be adequately captured within the main standards, these are contained in Appendices. If any provision of the GBS contravenes or is less restrictive than the applicable law of any jurisdiction, the local law will apply.
Equal Opportunity Apax Partners is a meritocracy and people are recruited and advanced on their ability. Apax is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for job applicants and team members, and is totally opposed to any form of discrimination on any grounds. The Firm aims to select, promote and treat individuals on the basis of their relevant skills and abilities. All team members are encouraged to work towards this objective.
Whistle-Blowing Apax values its reputation highly and does not tolerate any behaviour which could damage that reputation. If an Apax employee becomes aware of any behaviour during their time at Apax which they consider to be unprofessional or unacceptable, they are encouraged to raise it internally straight away. This includes behaviour which could give rise to increased risk to slavery or human trafficking and also includes racism, sexism, bullying, harassment or other types of unprofessional behaviour.
Our Supply Chain Our key suppliers are professional services firms who provide operational, commercial and financial advice for the review of investments made by the Funds.

Supplier adherence to Apax Partners values As mentioned previously, we do not tolerate slavery and human trafficking. We expect all those in our supply chain and our contractors to comply with our values and we are progressing and revising our contracting processes to reflect this expectation.
Training To ensure a higher level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we will provide training to relevant members of staff in the next 12 months and all Equity Partners will have been fully briefed on the subject.
Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking Given the nature of the Apax Partners advisory business, we believe there is a very low risk of slavery or human trafficking in connection with our activities, but in the coming 12 months we will be seeking to reinforce our approach in order to ensure that the wider Apax network will work with us to eradicate modern slavery.
Specifically we will ensure that the global Apax team receives training to understand the risks of modern slavery and we will include anti-slavery and human trafficking measures in our Global Business Standards. In addition, we will review and update our standard contracting process with suppliers.
Our Commitment We are committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to safeguard against slavery and human trafficking taking place anywhere in our business or supply chains.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our Firm’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2016. It has been approved by the Apax Partners Executive Committee

We pride ourselves in offering innovative and entertaining gift solutions for any moment. Our product categories range from Party & Drinking, Beauty & Fashion, Novelty, Games & Gadgets, and Stationery & Craft. Our Supply Chains We work directly with manufacturers in the Far East and Europe. We have adopted a risk-based approach to the assessment of our business and supply chain, which has involved taking geographical, industry and market factors into account in order to identify categories of supply that may present a higher risk of modern slavery being present. We are focusing our attention on suppliers in these categories areas initially, though any resulting policy changes will extend to the whole business. Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business, to comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking We communicate internally with our employees through our policies and procedures which are available in our staff Employee handbook. We issue a Code of Practice to all Far East manufacturers enforcing the importance of control and supervision in their work environment. We have a robust Vendor audit process in place that explores forced labour and potential slavery within the Supply Chain. Where possible we build long standing relationships with our vendors to make clear our expectations of business behavior. We will introduce the following procedures: Encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistle blowers. Review and assess existing suppliers, and in particular their sourcing policies in key risk areas. Review the existing Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure it remains an effective tool in areas of the business where a modern slavery risk is identified. Key Performance Indicators We use the following key performance indicators (KPI’s) to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains
Use of labour monitoring and payroll systems within HR Third Party Factory Audits in the Far East. NPW Compliance visits to the Far East several times a year to conduct our own audits verses our code of conduct.

Arnold Clark Automobiles Limited (“Arnold Clark”)
Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA), this statement provides the measures that Arnold Clark takes to prevent slavery and human trafficking occurring in its business and supply chains. Arnold Clark is fully committed to preventing acts of modern slavery and human trafficking from occurring within both its business and supply chains and requires the same standards from its suppliers. Arnold Clark operates retail sites and service centres across the UK. Its principal activities concern the sale, hire and servicing of automobiles. It represents 24 new car manufacturers and has 200 dealerships, 130 service centres, 40 accident repair centres and 13 parts centres. Arnold Clark also operates 35 car and van rental locations, three training facilities and six vehicle leasing business centres. Arnold Clark directly employs over 10,000 people.
The functions across Arnold Clark businesses are very broad. Arnold Clark:sells new and used vehicles arranges finance to enable customers to buy vehicles provides vehicle aftercare including the servicing and repair of vehicles for both businesses and the general public sells parts and accessories from its parts centres across the UK hires vehicles to the public and to businesses throughout the UK provides a suite of fleet management services to businesses in the public, private and third sectors provides and organises insurance conducts MOT testing carries out accident repairs; and sells workshop and bodyshop equipment to businesses and the general public
Its training centres provide various qualifications including apprenticeships, business courses and building trade courses. This statement will be made available on the company website, ArnoldClark.com, to all who engage with Arnold Clark whether in employment or in business so that those parties may acquaint themselves with the contents. Arnold Clark staff policies raise awareness amongst its staff of its Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking Statement. Along with its General Business Code of Conduct and Group CSR Policy, this statement sets out the reasonable and practical steps which Arnold Clark takes to ensure its standards are being implemented across its business and supply

chains.

The steps taken by Arnold Clark to prevent slavery and human trafficking
Arnold Clark prohibits all areas of its business and supply chains from using slavery and human trafficking of any kind.
Arnold Clark’s main protection against slavery is to ensure that all business activity complies with minimum wage legislation. Arnold Clark also requires this of its contractors. Arnold Clark’s first line of defence against human trafficking is to ensure that all Arnold Clark Group employees have the right to work in the UK. Arnold Clark also requires that UK contractors only employ staff with the right to work in the UK.
Due to the breadth of its businesses and supply chains Arnold Clark is not in a position to check every business relationship and avenue. The principal areas in which there is a risk of human trafficking and slavery are those related to our supply chains. Arnold Clark sources and sells products and parts from a broad range of national and international suppliers. To ensure that external supply chains comply with this policy Arnold Clark requires that the business practices and supply chains of each supplier are in accordance with the MSA and Arnold Clark monitors compliance by suitable levels of due diligence according to the level of risk which Arnold Clark assesses of the potential for human trafficking and/or modern slavery.
Any instances of non-compliance of which Arnold Clark is made aware will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Remedial action will be taken and tailored to suit the circumstances. Arnold Clark will only trade with those who fully comply with this statement or those who are taking steps towards full compliance. If Arnold Clark is not satisfied with the steps being taken towards full compliance, it will temporarily suspend its business with that supplier (to the extent permitted under contract or by law). The ultimate sanction for the continual failure to comply will be for Arnold Clark to cease to trade with that supplier (to the extent as permitted under contract or by law).
Arnold Clark will quickly and thoroughly investigate any claim or indication that any area of its business or supply chains is engaging in human trafficking or slave labour.
Any such claim coming to the attention of personnel within Arnold Clark would be reported to senior management in accordance with our Whistleblowing Policy. The board of directors will be informed of the issue including the findings and outcome of the investigation.
All Arnold Clark employees are provided with full details of Arnold Clark’s CSR Policy, Business Code of Conduct, Whistleblowing Policy and other company policies, including this statement. These are provided on the Arnold Clark employee portal. All employees are encouraged to familiarise themselves with this information at induction and by regular email updates. The Code of Conduct specifically outlines ethical business practice as integral to all our dealings and our expectation of compliance with applicable laws is absolute.
This statement has been approved by the board of directors of Arnold Clark, who will review and update it as necessary on an annual basis.

209,"Dairy Crest Group Plc
Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement for the Financial Year 2015/2016
We are committed to preventing modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain and in our business.
As a responsible company, we always aim to do the right thing and we have had robust practices and policies in place for many years to help us meet this objective. Following the implementation of the Modern Slavery Act in October 2015, we have undertaken a thorough review of our business and supply chain and we have outlined our approach to tackling this important issue below.
OUR BUSINESS
We are a leading British dairy company, manufacturing and selling branded products including Cathedral City cheese, Clover dairy spread, Country Life butter and Frylight one calorie cooking spray. We have also recently invested to enter the infant formula market.
Dairy Crest Group Plc is the parent company of the Dairy Crest group of companies (“Group”), which includes the manufacturing subsidiaries Dairy Crest Limited (producing cheese, spreads, whey and galacto-oligosaccharide), and MH Foods Limited (producing cooking oils).
The Group has an annual turnover of £422m; it has approximately 1100 employees and operates from seven sites across the UK (our head office, five manufacturing sites and our recently built innovation centre).
Vision and values
Our business strategies, practices, policies and ways of working are governed by our vision and values:
Our vision: “Our success has been built on our links to the countryside, our dairy heritage and the people in our business. From this, we will grow through a shared passion to create exceptional food, loved by every generation.”
Our values: We Learn – we take time to listen, understand and learn
We Respect – we value people we work with and are stronger together
We Care – we act responsibly with a passion to do the right thing
We Create – we seek new ideas to grow our business
We Lead – we drive for success and deliver at pace
Our sites
Dairy Crest Limited’s manufacturing sites are regularly audited by an independent third party called Sedex (the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) in line with internationally recognised codes of labour practice. The MH Foods factory is a small manufacturing facility with just 50 employees, and is closely monitored at a high level with its Managing Director based on site.
Managing risk within the business
Overall responsibility for risk within the Group is managed by the Group Board, supported by the Audit Committee which reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management processes and

internal controls. The Board has delegated management of day-to-day operational risks to the Executive Committee which normally meets on a weekly basis. The Corporate Responsibility Committee, a committee of the Group Board, also normally meets four times a year on behalf of the Group Board to ensure that corporate responsibility and sustainability remain integral to the Group’s business, operations and culture.
Training and policies
In 2015 we rolled out our Ethics Toolkit to all office based staff to train them to recognise and deal with various ethical considerations including issues such as exploitation and forced labour. All new joiners in office roles are required to complete this course. We also have a clear Whistleblowing Policy which encourages the reporting and exposure of unethical and illegal behaviour.
Our internal policies reflect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. Policies such as Respect at Work, Business Conduct and Ethical Trading protect our employees and raise awareness of the risk of key issues such as forced labour and intimidation within the business and also in our supply chain.
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
We are committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.
General procurement
Through our supply chain we source ingredients, packaging and services. Whilst the majority of our direct suppliers are based in the UK, we recognise that our extended supply chain may originate from around the world.
We have a Supplier Corporate Responsibility Policy in place which extends the Group’s vision and values across our entire supplier base. This policy sets out the minimum standards expected by the Group of its suppliers and their supply chains in order to manage the impacts of our operations in a responsible manner. The policy includes a specific section prohibiting slavery and forced labour. We have incorporated compliance with this policy into our standard purchasing terms and conditions and all suppliers are required to comply with it. In addition, all MH Food suppliers are required to complete Sedex audit questionnaires, which include sections dealing with forced labour and wider human rights.
In 2013 Dairy Crest Limited implemented the EcoVadis Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) monitoring platform to identify, assess and mitigate potential risk areas (including slavery and human trafficking) in our supply chain. This platform combines CSR assessment expertise and data management tools, which allow us to monitor the ethical, social and environmental performance of key direct and indirect suppliers. The platform also provides a methodology for following up on and dealing with suppliers where risk is identified and measuring compliance with our Supplier Corporate Responsibility Policy.
Milk procurement
We have approximately 400 dedicated milk producers based in the South West of England, all of whom must meet the minimum labour standards set out in our Milk Producer Corporate Responsibility Policy. The majority of these farms are family owned and run, and our farm business managers keep in close contact with all of our milk producers on a regular basis. This includes frequent farm visits to check and monitor conditions.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the Dairy Crest Group's slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2016.

BRIGHTHOUSE MODERN DAY SLAVERY STATEMENT 2018/19
This is our third annual statement on Modern Slavery and this has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out the steps taken by BrightHouse and other relevant group companies and the ongoing work and commitments to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains.
Introduction
We know that slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking (Modern Slavery) is a global and growing issue given the rapid rise in global migration, existing in every region in the world and in every type of economy, whether industrialised, developing or in transition. No sector or industry can be considered immune or untainted. BrightHouse has a zero tolerance approach to Modern Slavery of any kind within our operations and supply chain. We all have a responsibly to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. We are committed to strengthening our proposition and further developing robust systems and management tools to ensure there are no opportunities for Modern Slavery to exist in our supply Chain.
Our business
BrightHouse is the largest rent to own retail in the UK, with a revenue of £320 million and a product range that includes furniture, domestic appliances, technology and audio visual products. This is supported with 283 stores and 2600 colleagues from retail to supply chain. Our Supply chain encompasses engineering, refurbishment and distribution. At the heart of everything we do is integrity: treating customers fairly, providing great jobs, nurturing our communities, building mutually beneficial business relationships, protecting the environment and our commitment to ethical trading.
Our supply chains
We purchase products on a worldwide basis. We recognise that, whilst there are different legal, financial and cultural environments in different countries. BrightHouse aims to buy products from suppliers and factories which can demonstrate an awareness of, and comply with, the appropriate social and ethical standards.
Due diligence processes
For our own brand and non ‘A’ brand product suppliers we continue to carry out comprehensive due diligence checks and factory audits, reviewing and expecting our producers to meet at least the minimum standards in respect of health and safety, wages, working hours, equal opportunities, freedom of association, collective bargaining and disciplinary procedures. It is also strictly not acceptable to employ any forced or child labour. Approved suppliers are then subject to regular checks and audits. Audits are carried out with a view to assisting them in improving their working practices; where this is not possible or no improvements are made, the supplier relationship will be terminated.
All suppliers including ‘A’ brand suppliers will be required to provide an ethical Audit report which will cover all aspects of ethical trading including Modern Slavery indicators during the current trading year, any supplier who fails to provide this report or resolve any remedial actions generated from this process will be de-listed as a supplier.
Ongoing Actions / Further Steps
To continue to safeguard against slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains we are collaborating with our suppliers, their production facilities and ethical audit suppliers including SEDEX to continue to develop appropriate risk-based processes that will enable us to further extend the requirements of The Modern Slavery Act.
We will continue to raise awareness among colleagues and teams who are responsible for or engaged in sourcing with suppliers and for all our suppliers and products we will continue to develop and implement an Ethical Sourcing Policy which will includes Anti-Slavery and which reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We will require all suppliers to prove they have effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our extended supply chains.
This statement has been approved by the BrightHouse board of Directors on behalf of the Group. A new statement will be published each year on the corporate website https://www.brighthousegroup.co.uk

MODERN SLAVERY ACT1 STATEMENT 2016

British American Tobacco (BAT) has a longstanding commitment to respect fundamental human rights, as affirmed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This includes always conducting our operations in ways that respect the human rights of our employees, the people we work with and the communities in which we operate.
We are aware of slavery in the world today and consequently take a zero tolerance approach to it in all forms. This encompasses slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking2, affecting some of the world’s most vulnerable individuals and groups, often through exploitation by criminal gangs.
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that almost 21 million people are, currently, victims of forced labour, of whom almost 19 million are exploited by private individuals or enterprises3. All businesses run the risk of being exposed to modern slavery, either within their own operations or those of their extended supply chain.
This statement outlines the steps taken by the BAT Group between 1 January and 31 December 2016, to prevent slavery and human trafficking occurring within our business and supply chain, and is written in accordance with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, covering BAT p.l.c. and subsidiary Group companies4. This activity takes place within our broader human rights strategy, more details of which can be found in our Sustainability Report 2016.

OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAINS
BAT is one of the world’s leading multinational companies, employing around 50,000 people, with a 2016 turnover of over £14 billion.
We produce and sell a range of tobacco and nicotine products for adult consumers, including: cigarettes, Fine Cut tobacco, Swedish-style snus and Next Generation Products (Vapour Products, or e-cigarettes, and Tobacco Heating Products).
In 2016, we sold 665 billion cigarettes in more than 200 markets worldwide, which are made in 44 BAT factories in 42 countries. Our Vapour and Tobacco Heating Products are manufactured in third-party factories and are currently available in 12 markets.
Our supply chain consists of two discrete elements:
Tobacco leaf agricultural supply chain
Tobacco remains the most essential part of our product and the farmers who grow it are absolutely crucial to the success of our business.
We buy more than 400,000 tonnes of tobacco leaf each year from suppliers located in 33 countries, which are managed centrally by our Group Leaf Function, and include:
• BAT-owned companies, which directly contract and support over 90,000 farmers; and
• Third-party suppliers, which contract with their own farmers.
We also purchase a small amount of tobacco leaf sourced from auction floors.
The farms in our supply chain vary in size and complexity. The majority are smallholder family farms of a hectare or less, as well as some larger farms which employ hired labour to tend and harvest the tobacco leaf.
Non-agricultural supply chain
In addition to tobacco leaf, the other direct materials we buy to make our products, such as paper and filters and the components that go into our Next Generation Products, represent our highest value strategic supply chain. In 2016, we had over 6,000 direct materials suppliers, managed by our global, regional and local Procurement teams.
In addition, we have over 65,000 suppliers of other goods and services, such as machinery, IT and consultancy.

400,000+ TONNES

OUR POLICIES, PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS
Our approach is underpinned by clear policies, principles and standards that detail the way we do business and how we behave. They include:
Our Statement of Business Principles which sets out our beliefs and values as an organisation. It includes our long-standing commitment to respect fundamental human rights, as affirmed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Our Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC) which apply those values and principles to specific situations, which may arise in our day-to-day business life, and cover our Policy commitments. These Standards were updated in 2014 to include our Human Rights Policy, outlining our commitment to conduct our operations in a way that respects the human rights of our employees, the people we work with, and the communities in which we operate. Specifically, this states that we do not condone forced, bonded or involuntary labour, or the exploitation or unlawful use of immigrant labour.
Every Group company and every employee worldwide is expected to live up to the Standards. Compliance is monitored through a formal process which requires all staff working across the Group to complete an annual sign-off to confirm their commitment and adherence and to re-declare any personal conflicts of interest. Continuous information on compliance is also gathered at a global level and reported through the year to our Regional Audit and CSR committees, and quarterly to the Main Board Audit Committee.
Our Whistleblowing Policy also sits within the SoBC. Robust procedures are in place throughout the Group to provide additional guidance and support to staff, and to enable them to report grievances and issues of concern in confidence, without fear of reprisal, and in their local language.
We have always expected our suppliers to follow the same high standards, but to clarify this further and to complement the SoBC, in 2016, we introduced our Supplier Code of Conduct. This defines the minimum standards required of all our suppliers, including the respect of human rights, and is incorporated into our contractual arrangements with suppliers. Specifically, the Code requires that all suppliers ensure their operations are free from forced, bonded, involuntary, trafficked or unlawful migrant labour.
Find details of these, and all our other policies, principles and standards, at
 WWW.BAT.COM/PRINCIPLES
SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT
requires all suppliers to ensure their operations are FREE FROM forced, bonded, involuntary, trafficked or unlawful migrant labour

OUR APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE
Our long-standing due diligence processes enable us to monitor the effectiveness of, and compliance with, our Policy commitments, as well as to identify, prevent and mitigate human rights risks and impacts. Our Main Board of Directors has overall responsibility for these issues.
Reporting mechanisms ensure that any instances of non-compliance with our Standards of Business Conduct are brought to the attention of the Main Board Audit Committee.
Agricultural supply chains are particularly vulnerable to a range of challenges, including climate change and water scarcity, increasing demand for land and natural resources, rural poverty and social inequality, child labour and ageing farmer populations. Tobacco is no exception.
Based on careful assessment and the insights developed over many years, we believe that the greatest risk of modern slavery is in our tobacco leaf supply chain. At the same time, we acknowledge the potential – albeit lower – risk of modern slavery in our non-agricultural supply chain.
Tobacco leaf agricultural supply chain
We conduct due diligence on our tobacco leaf supply chain through the Sustainable Tobacco Programme (STP), which assesses and monitors suppliers’ performance in meeting industry-wide standards.
The programme assesses the first-tier suppliers we buy tobacco leaf from, some of which are BAT-owned companies. It checks if they have the appropriate systems, governance and procedures in place to ensure high environmental and human rights standards on the farms they source from, and provide the best quality tobacco leaf.
STP was developed in 2015 in collaboration with five other tobacco manufacturers to bring together best practice from across the industry. Implementation began in June 2016, replacing our Social Responsibility in Tobacco Production programme, which ran for more than 15 years (for which aggregated supplier scores were published annually at www.bat.com/srtpdata).
The programme is aligned to important external standards, such as those of the ILO, and includes strengthened processes and more frequent on-site reviews. It is managed by AB Sustain, an independent supply chain management company, which is responsible for coordinating the annual self-assessments from suppliers across the industry, and also for conducting the on-site reviews, which each supplier undergoes on a three-year rolling basis.
The programme has 178 criteria under the key areas of: crop, environment, people and facilities. Suppliers must also show that they have good governance underpinning all four areas and are required to assess, identify and mitigate any significant risks which may affect their ability to meet the criteria.
The criteria include a number relating specifically to forced labour, covering prevention of bond, debt and threat, freedom to leave employment, withholding of payments, retention of identity documents and valuables, and prison and compulsory labour.
Suppliers (including those supplying several tobacco companies) complete a comprehensive annual self-assessment. Independent onsite reviews will also be carried out every three years by AB Sustain, including in-depth analyses of suppliers’ policies, processes and practices and visits to the tobacco farms they source from.
We will use the results of the self-assessments and the on-site reviews to work collaboratively with suppliers to drive corrective action and improvements. In the event of any serious and/or persistent issues, or where suppliers fail to demonstrate a willingness to improve performance, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship.

3 British American Tobacco | Modern Slavery Statement 2016

MODERN SLAVERY RISK AND MANAGEMENT
The risks of slavery and human trafficking in our own business operations are substantially avoided and mitigated as a result of the suite of robust policies, practices, compliance procedures and governance oversight that we have in place across all Group companies.
As stated above, we consider the greatest risk of slavery and human trafficking to be in our tobacco leaf agricultural supply chain.
In 2016, other than those detailed below, no incidents of modern slavery or forced labour were identified through our due diligence processes, and no incidents, grievances or concerns relating to modern slavery or forced labour were reported or identified through our whistleblowing procedures or grievance mechanisms.

Non-agricultural supply chain
In 2016, we worked to build upon and strengthen our existing supplier assessment programme for strategic direct materials suppliers, to be better aligned to the UN Guiding Principles and extending it to cover all of our 70,000+ non-agricultural first-tier suppliers worldwide.
This included working with experts from Verisk Maplecroft, a respected independent consultancy, to develop a systematic, integrated supply chain due diligence (SCDD) process.
The starting point for SCDD is to assess each supplier’s inherent human rights risk based on the type of supplier and the country where it operates. To do this, we use a series of Verisk Maplecroft’s human rights indices, including the Modern Slavery Index. We then prioritise those suppliers identified as being exposed to the highest risks and ask them to complete a self-assessment questionnaire.
The latter is structured around the key areas of our Supplier Code of Conduct and provides us with information on the policies, procedures and practices the supplier has in place to effectively manage these risks.
Where the results of the self-assessment highlight minor areas for improvement, we work with the supplier to develop corrective actions and agree a timescale for material progress towards compliance.
Where the results reveal more significant issues, an on-site audit will be conducted by our independent auditor, Intertek. This includes criteria on labour standards – with a specific section focusing on forced labour – as well as child labour, wages and hours, health and safety, environment and management systems.
Should the audit identify areas of concern, we agree an action plan with the supplier that includes clear timescales for improvements to be made. In the event of serious and/or persistent non-compliance, or where suppliers fail to demonstrate a willingness to improve performance, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship.
Having successfully tested the process in 2016, we are now conducting a phased roll out to all our non-agricultural suppliers worldwide.
In addition to audits triggered by the SCDD process, all of our strategic direct materials suppliers, as part of our existing supplier assessment programme, have to undergo the same audit, also conducted by Intertek, in order to be appointed as a new supplier to BAT. They are then re-audited every three to four years.

Tobacco leaf agricultural supply chain
In June 2016 Swedwatch, a non-governmental organisation, published a report entitled ‘Smokescreens in the supply chain: The impacts of the tobacco industry on human rights and the environment in Bangladesh’5. Among its findings, the report alleged that many tobacco farmers in Bangladesh risk being trapped in a cycle of overindebtedness, and that this “raises the risk of the farmers being in a situation equivalent to that of bonded labour”6.
As a result, we conducted our own internal review in Bangladesh and remain of the view that the report as a whole is not representative of the reality on the ground. However, we recognise the serious nature of the allegations and so have commissioned an independent assessment of the human rights related impacts of tobacco growing in the country and will use the results to address any issues that may be identified.
In addition, there have been ongoing allegations of human rights abuses on unspecified tobacco farms in our United States (US) supply chain, including concerns raised regarding migrant workers’ awareness of their rights for freedom of association and unionisation.
We prioritised an independent on-site review of our US supply chain in 2015, along with a separate independent report to examine the specific allegations – neither of which uncovered any evidence of wrongdoing. However, we continue to engage with the relevant stakeholders and work with our associate company, Reynolds American Inc (RAI) – including RAI’s subsidiary RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company – to address these concerns. This includes RJ Reynolds’ participation in the Farm Labor Practices Group (FLPG), a US-based multi-stakeholder forum established to directly promote compliance with the laws protecting worker rights in the US tobacco supply chain.
Our approach to working directly with our contracted farmers and supporting rural communities can help to address rural poverty, which is recognised as one of the root causes of modern slavery in agriculture.
Our recently launched Sustainable Agriculture and Farmer Livelihoods (SAFL) programme – which builds on the work our agricultural Extension Services and field technicians have undertaken with farmers over many years – aims to enhance farmer livelihoods and, in doing so, minimise the risk that they resort to the use of forced or bonded labour. More information on SAFL can be found in our Sustainability Report 2016.

We are acutely aware that different farm settings face different challenges, which may affect the likelihood of modern slavery occurring. In addition to the formal reviews as part of the Sustainable Tobacco Programme, our expert field technicians around the world regularly visit more than 90,000 famers in our tobacco leaf supply chain. These visits give our staff the opportunity to check conditions on the ground and provide a further safeguard against forced or bonded labour being used within our supply chain.
90,000+ FARMERS WORLDWIDE
are regularly visited by our expert field technicians
Non-agricultural supply chain
In 2016, an Intertek audit of a direct materials supplier in Thailand identified one incident relating to forced labour. This related to the supplier’s non-compliance with local laws concerning the amount of notice employees need to give prior to terminating their employment.
We are now working with the supplier to implement a corrective action plan to address this issue.
MODERN SLAVERY TRAINING
In 2016, we delivered the following training that included specific content on human rights and modern slavery:
• Training webinars for our Legal and External Affairs employees on our Standards of Business Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct;
• A global roll out of new training and communications materials for all employees worldwide on our Standards of Business Conduct, clarifying what they should do if they discover actions that conflict with our Standards;
• A series of workshops with our BAT-owned and third-party tobacco leaf suppliers across the globe to introduce the Sustainable Tobacco Programme (STP) and its specific criteria on human rights and forced labour. They then delivered training to their teams and farmers; and
• Through our agricultural Extension Services, we provided training and capacity building on human rights issues for our farmers and members of local communities, attended by over 60,000 beneficiaries.
In 2017, we will develop and roll out a new human rights e-learning package to colleagues working within our Procurement and Legal and External Affairs functions.

MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROGRAMME
With the exception of the cases detailed above, no incidents of modern slavery were identified during 2016.
Notwithstanding this evidence of the effectiveness of our approach, we have devoted considerable effort throughout the year to improving the robustness of our systems and, in particular, extending our due diligence to include all of our non-agricultural first-tier direct and indirect suppliers.
In 2017, these enhancements, as well as the implementation of the industry-wide Sustainable Tobacco Programme (STP) and our own Sustainable Agriculture and Farmer Livelihoods (SAFL) programme, will strengthen our management and public reporting of the risks associated with modern slavery. Specifically, we will:
• F ollowing the first full year of implementation, publish our suppliers’ aggregated STP scores from 2018;
• Report on how our SAFL programme is contributing to improvements in farmers’ incomes and, in doing so, helping to address one of the root causes of forced and bonded labour;
• Publish the summary findings of the independent report on the human rights related impacts of tobacco growing in Bangladesh;
• Strengthen and increase the accessibility of our whistleblowing procedures and grievance mechanisms, through implementing a new third-party managed Speak Up hotline and website by end 2017; and
• Continue to publish aggregated details of all whistleblowing reports, including those relating to human rights, in our Sustainability Performance Centre.

INTRODUCTION
At White Stuff we continue to create products that are made with integrity and finished to the highest standard.We choose good quality and ethical suppliers to work with and this is reflected in our goods. Creating responsibly is a key foundation to our business.This means
that we endeavour to source, produce and sell all of our products in this way.
OUR COMMITMENT
We published our first Modern Slavery statement in October 2016.We welcomed the legislation because we recognise our responsibility towards people working in our own business and in our supply chain. Our Create Responsibly Strategy
continues to be one of the five pillars of our brand vision.We promote the welfare and wellbeing of our communities, locally and globally, by creating connections and creating products responsibly. Delivering this aim is our dedicated Ethical Sourcing team who are committed to sourcing products in a way that improves the wellbeing of the people in our supply chain.This year, we have taken steps to educate key stakeholders about the risks of slavery, in partnership with NGOs and other brands that are members of Ethical Trading Initiative. Our policies are continually reviewed to make sure that they are relevant.We have taken steps towards checking the conditions of workers further down the supply chain, using a risk based approach to assess where our priorities need to be. After mapping the factories in the second and third tiers of our clothing suppliers, we undertook a pilot audit programme in India in February 2017 for our second tier suppliers.We have
also developed more in depth training for our Turkish suppliers. This statement has been approved by the board of directors.
Jeremy Seigal - CEO, White Stuff Ltd
October 2017
OUR BUSINESS
White Stuff employs 2000 people: 1500 in the UK across 160 Shops & Concessions; 350 employees within our Head Offices based in London & Leicester; and 120 employed within International shops in continental Europe.We have 120
product suppliers and 400 non-product suppliers, including recruitment agencies, logistics and shop fitting services.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2017
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
Our suppliers currently manufacture in sixteen countries across the world in 160 factories. 80% of our clothing and products are made in four main countries: China; India;Turkey and Portugal.The workers who work in these ‘first tier’ factories produce and
package the finished product. Each factory has been ethically audited to check the working conditions by our own specially trained auditors. By working closely with our suppliers to resolve issues we are proud that we have improved the working conditions for
60,000 workers in these factories over the year.
Clothing supply chains are complex, and ours is no different.Workers in the ‘second tier’ contribute significantly to the manufacture of our clothing and products.They spin and weave or knit the yarn, then finish, dye and print our fabrics.This year we have made
progress to map the extent of our second and third tier factories by asking our ‘first tier’ suppliers to provide details of their supply chains.They were happy to help and we now have a significant amount of information about these factories. As well as mapping our second tier, we ask suppliers in the first tier to ensure our Code of Conduct is signed up to by factories in their supply chain, as part
of our work as members of the Ethical Trading Initiative.
OUR POLICIES
Our internal policies are designed to educate and enable people to put our values into practice. Our own business policies relating to modern slavery provide a framework and process to support and protect our colleagues, suppliers and customers.These include:
THE ANTI BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION POLICY THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES POLICY THE WHISTLE BLOWING POLICY
THE ETHICAL SOURCING CODE OF CONDUCT
Our policies are designed to help our people consistently live our values and encourage them to report any issues of concern.We have a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) committee who champion this.The committee make sure that our existing policies remain both relevant and useful, for example to include our commitment to educate our people and our supply chain about the
modern slavery act and our responsibilities.
Our ethical sourcing policies have had a positive impact on the workers in our supply chain.We resolved over 1200 issues, from labour and wage problems to health and safety, found during ethical audits within our first tier factories throughout the year.The effectiveness of our policies means that we resolve issues in a shorter amount of time; issues are now resolved in an average of 10 weeks rather than 18 weeks that it took last year. Resolving our issues quicker meant that we had the time to carry out a second tier
pilot programme.
We continue to work closely with our team of in-country auditors to develop new ways of detecting issues, such as modern slavery. We have adopted a new auditing approach in Turkey where we do unannounced audits because of the high numbers of refugees in the country, many seeking work in the textile supply chain. As a responsible company, we want to ensure all workers are being treated fairly and not being discriminated against or employed against their will, in line with our Code of Conduct.
We are committed to train our own people and we completed this in a number of different ways. We trained 450 White Stuff employees about the Modern Slavery Act and the possibility that modern slavery may be present in our business and supply chains. We explained how we are and will be checking working conditions to ensure there are processes to detect and remedy modern slavery. Communication is now a regular feature of our ‘Family Gathering’ meetings at our HQ in London and our DC in Leicester, in addition to our Brand Vision inductions for new starters and as part of our product team meetings.We share information for all our teams on our internal intranet,The Tea Room. We have also improved access to information on our activities on our website, making
it easier for our customers to navigate:

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2017
DUE DILIGENCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT
We have engaged with each of our first tier suppliers to educate them on the Modern Slavery legislation.We are aware that there are many workers who contribute to the manufacture of our clothing and products further down the supply chain and this is why we
have started to take a look at the conditions in some of the lower tier factories.
We carried out a risk assessment across our first tier supplier base to help us choose which second tier factories to focus on. Our clothing suppliers make up our largest proportion of product purchase at over 90%.We asked them to disclose the names and
addresses of their suppliers who contribute to the manufacturing of our clothing so we could map and asses the highest risk.With a 75% response rate, we were able to look at the information supplied and compare that with political, social and human rights risks. As a result, we concluded that we should conduct a pilot programme in India and further training for our suppliers based in Turkey.
During the pilot programme, we were granted access to visit and audit five second tier factories who supply our first tier clothing suppliers in India, accompanied by their ethical compliance managers so we could tackle the issues together.There were many learnings from this pilot programme that we will build upon going forward. Here are three key outcomes:
1. In general fabric mills, printers and dyers are much larger factories and geographically further far apart from those which cut and sew, making the workers more difficult to access.
2. It is important that our auditor in India has an understanding of the different processes in these factories. She now has an understanding of the possible non-compliances to look out for.
3.There are many chemical processes in the manufacture of textiles and we were able to share practical advice directly with the workers on the importance of safely handling chemicals.
In January 2017 we held a workshop for our Turkish suppliers at our London Head Office.We discussed the situation and risks associated with the growing migrant population in their country.We invited Anti-Slavery International to present an interactive session where the risks were highlighted and ways to mitigate were discussed. At the workshop, we announced a change to our audit programme from announced to unannounced audits. Each supplier showed support for this and felt confident that their respective
factories had in place effective policies and procedures. We successfully carried out these audits and timed them in line with production peaks. Our auditors were able to validate that these first tier factories are those that manufacture our clothing. Satisfied with the results of these audits, we will be sharing the results of our second tier pilot programme with them and encouraging them
to check conditions of workers at their direct suppliers with the assistance of our audit team.
During the year, we have contacted our non-product suppliers to raise awareness and ask specific questions relating to their compliance with the Modern Slavery Act.We have received over 50% responses and half of those that replied are required to comply with the Act, having a turnover in excess of £36 million. We are in the process of collating their statements and sending out reminders to the non-responders.Where a non-product supplier has a lower turnover, we are asking them to sign up to our Code of
Conduct.

Our commitment against modern slavery
Within Aegon UK we strive to prohibit any form of modern slavery or human trafficking in our business and supply chain. We operate under a Code of Conduct that is applicable to all Aegon Group employees across the globe, and which contains the following commitments (amongst others):
•   We are a responsible company in an ever changing business environment •   We are committed to upholding internationally recognised human rights •   We comply with all applicable laws and regulations and proactively promote such
compliance •   We strive to deal with business partners who share our core values •   We treat our stakeholders fairly •   We promote ethical behaviour and encourage the reporting of any illegal or unethical
behaviour •   We hire, promote and pay our employees fairly and do so based on their qualifications,
their experience and their ability to do their job •   We allow our employees the right of free association (trade union membership) •   We are committed to behaving responsibly and contributing to the long term well-being
of the communities in which our employees live and work
All Aegon UK employees are required to complete an annual Computer Based Training module on the Code of Conduct.
No modern slavery within Aegon UK
We strive to maintain and comply with a comprehensive suite of HR policies, governing the rights and entitlements of all employees working for Aegon UK, including with regard to health and safety, working hours, pay, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment.

We recognise Aegis the Union and Unite the Union to represent our employees and for collective bargaining in respect of employee terms and conditions. We encourage our employees to join the union recognised for their particular role/work location.
Our HR policies have been reviewed in the last 12 months and the terms, conditions and benefits of Aegon UK employees have been assessed to ensure that they comply with or exceed legal and regulatory requirements and to ensure that they are competitive within the financial services market in which we operate.
This year, we enhanced our vetting processes for employees and workers, by including regular background screening checks for financial sanctions, politically exposed persons (PEP) and certain charges related to financial crime, including organised crime and trafficking.
No modern slavery in Aegon UK’s supply chain
Under our procurement and supplier management policies, we strive to ensure a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.
We operate a supplier management process under which each of our suppliers is categorised to reflect the supplier’s criticality to Aegon UK’s business and the level of risk posed by their operations. Each year we carry out due diligence, risk assessments, contract management, site visits, audits and monitoring, as appropriate to the categorisation of each supplier, to ensure their compliance with applicable law, regulation and with the requirements of our procurement and supplier management policies.
All of our key suppliers are now required to confirm on an annual basis that they comply with applicable laws, including those relating to modern slavery and human trafficking. We have reviewed our standard contracts and strive to ensure that new suppliers comply with all applicable law and regulation, including laws and regulations against modern slavery and human trafficking. We would regard any instance of modern slavery or human trafficking in a supplier as a fundamental breach of contract, and would take appropriate action up to and including termination of that contract.
This statement is approved by the Aegon UK Executive Committee on 17 June 2019 and made in respect of the Aegon UK Group and covers the financial year ending 31 December 2018.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2016

DVB BANK SE MODERN SLAVERY SATEMENT

INTRODUCTION

The Modern Slavery Act (MSA) is UK legislation which received Royal Assent in 2015. The serious criminal offences of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking are consolidated under one piece of legislation. The intention of the Act is to bring perpetrators to justice, provide law enforcement agencies with stronger tools to tackle modern slavery and enhance protection for victims.

The MSA requires companies to publish an annual statement setting out the steps they have taken to prevent all forms of modern slavery in their business and supply chains. We welcome the Modern Slavery Act and its aim to create meaningful and long-lasting improvement to workers’ e­ mployment and workplace conditions including, but not limited to, the prevention of forced, bonded and trafficked labour. Our commitment is to be upheld through the development of the company’s policies, governance structures and a supportive leadership programme.

OUR BUSINESS

We enjoy a unique position, thanks to our strategic focus on the international transport market, with the submarkets of shipping, aviation, offshore, and land transport. As a highly-specialised bank, we offer to more than 600 clients and client groups a broad range of customised financial services. Our mission statement “The specialist in international transport finance” captures both the Bank’s real accomplishments and its vision of the future.
DVB’s highly-qualified and experienced staff focus on arranging and providing structured financing solutions, advisory services, and investment activities on behalf of its clients. We market our products and s­ ervices through eleven offices located in key transport hubs all around the world. This global presence enables us to take into ac-

count the international dimension as well as the local specifics of the markets in which our clients operate, ensuring in-depth client coverage. At the same time, we are thus in a position to maintain close contacts to manufacturers and leasing companies.
The Bank’s financial services can largely be allocated to six value-adding areas. We support clients in our Shipping Finance, Aviation Finance, Offshore Finance and Land Transport Finance divisions in the key product areas of Structured Asset Lending, Asset Management, Client Account, Risk Distribution & Loan Participations, Corporate Finance Solutions and Private Equity Sourcing & Investments.

OUR APPROACH TO THE MSA 

We will map our supply chains to assess particular industry/sector and geographical risk. These assessments will cover the entire scope of our business in the UK including our product supply chains.
This will involve but is not limited to:

// Assessing our business and supply chains to identify any material changes which could have an impact on efforts to prevent modern slavery occurring; and
// Providing bespoke training for staff and raising awareness within the Bank.

// The Project Sustainability group reviewing our policies and procedures to formulate a strategic plan of monitoring with view to develop an internal reporting framework and key performance indicators to oversee ongoing performance;

We are committed to running our business responsibly and in accordance with the high standards expected of a regulated institution. Our core values which include acting fairly, ethically and with transparency define how we operate and where we place our priorities. Such values are plainly incompatible with slavery and human trafficking.

DVB BANK SE MODERN SLAVERY SATEMENT

DUE DILIGENCE

The Bank has built long-standing relationships with suppliers and will make clear our expectations of business behaviour. We are in the process of carrying out a thorough due diligence on all our high-risk suppliers so that the risk of modern slavery is considered as part of our procurement process.

In order to monitor these risk areas in our supply chains on an ongoing basis, we are planning to conduct audits of high-risk suppliers, particularly those suppliers that operate out of countries ranked highly on the Walk Free Foundation’s Global Slavery Index, which measures the estimated prevalence of modern slavery.

TRAINING

To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we will be providing training to all our

staff involved in procurement and/or with r­esponsibility for our supply chain management.

CONCLUSION

If we discover a violation of the MSA, we will respond in a manner proportionate to the nature and extent of the violation. Serious violations will require immediate and decisive action and may result in the termination of the business relationship. For less serious violations, we will allow the supplier reasonable time to develop and implement a plan for remediation. We will treat termination as a last resort as it is unlikely to resolve the underlying issue and it may be detrimental to those people who rely on the work to survive.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2016 and has been approved by our Board of Managing Directors.

Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement
Home  Modern Slavery Act
Introduction from the Managing Director
H I Weldrick recognises that all businesses have an obligation to prevent slavery and human trafficking. Every company must do its share to eradicate this modern day scourge. H I Weldrick will do all in its power to prevent slavery and human trafficking within its business and within the supply chains through which it operates.
H I Weldrick recognises that, because of its position as a regulated member of the healthcare industry, compliance with its regulatory obligations reduces the risk that it will be engaging directly in human trafficking and slavery but, nevertheless, acknowledges that it has a part to play.
Organisation’s Structure
H I Weldrick is a retail pharmaceutical company, with pharmacies based predominantly throughout South Yorkshire and its Branch Support Centre in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.
Our Business
Our business consists of retail pharmacies, an online pharmacy and retail chemist’s sundry supplier and a warehousing hub.
Our Supply Chains
Our supply chains are concentrated on pharmaceutical products, mainly supplied via large wholesale organisations. Our workforce is almost exclusively professionally qualified at one level or another and regulated by external bodies.
Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business.
H I Weldrick operates to ensure fairness in the recruitment retention and development of all employees and it seeks to comply with all applicable employment legislation.
The company seeks to provide a work environment where employees are treated with respect, dignity and consideration.
H I Weldrick monitors its supply chains and its suppliers so ensure, so far as is possible, that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within those supply chains.
Due Diligence Process for Slavery and Human Trafficking
As part of our commitment to identify and eradicate slavery and human trafficking from within our business and from those businesses with which we interact, we-
Work closely with our supply chains to ensure compliance with legislative obligations and we expect those organisations to have suitable anti-slavery and human trafficking policies and processes. We seek to build long standing relationships with suppliers and to make clear our expectations of ethical business behaviour from them. We have in place systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistle blowers.
Supplier Adherence to our Values
H I Weldrick has a zero tolerance view to slavery and human trafficking and we expect that view to prevail in our supply chain and contractors.
Senior Managers within H I Weldrick are responsible for compliance in their respective departments, insofar as there is perceived to be a risk of encouraging, engaging or sustaining slavery and human trafficking.
Training
To ensure appropriate levels or risk awareness in respect of modern slavery and human trafficking, we provide training to relevant members of staff and, in particular, to senior Managers in our Buying Department and our Personnel Department. All Directors in the business have been briefed on the subject.
Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking
As has been stated above, we believe that, because of our position within the healthcare industry and our reliance upon direct, one to one recruitment processes, with subsequent monitoring of performance and the attainment of regulatory standards, our exposure within our human resources to human trafficking and slavery is low.
This statement is made to pursuant to Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes H I Weldrick’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the current financial year.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Odyssey Reinsurance Company and its subsidiaries (""OdysseyRe"")
This Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement is made pursuant to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 for the most
recent financial year, and describes the steps OdysseyRe has taken to assess the risk of human trafficking or slavery
in our own businesses or in any of our supply chains. OdysseyRe is committed to combatting all forms of slavery
and human trafficking, and to carrying out our business in a fair, honest, ethical and transparent manner. We do
not engage in or make use of any form of modern slavery, and to the best of our knowledge neither do any of our
supply chains. We are also committed to ensuring our employees remain aware of these issues and report any
related concerns to senior management within OdysseyRe.
Our Business Operations
OdysseyRe provides specialty insurance and reinsurance throughout the world through our insurance and
reinsurance companies, including our UK-based Newline Syndicate 1218 and Newline Insurance Company Limited,
and US-based Odyssey Reinsurance Company, operating in the UK through a reinsurance branch. OdysseyRe is
itself a member of the Fairfax Group, led by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. All OdysseyRe employees are treated
and compensated fairly, and there is no slavery or human trafficking within OdysseyRe.
Our Supply Chains
OdysseyRe's business is insurance and reinsurance, which we deliver to our clients through trading relationships
with wholesale brokers, insurance agents, Lloyd's brokers and reinsurance intermediaries, including global
reinsurance brokers. We have very few, if any, supply chains connected with the services we provide. Nevertheless,
we remain vigilant regarding matters involving basic human rights, such as slavery and human trafficking, and we
conduct due diligence as appropriate to ensure we do not knowingly do business with suppliers who engage such
practices. In addition, we also seek to include compliance with all local laws and regulations in contracts with our
suppliers.
As with all of our business activities, our contracts with suppliers are entered into in accordance with applicable
outsourcing policies, as well as OdysseyRe's and the Fairfax Group's various other policies, including our Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics, Anti-Money Laundering Policy, Whistleblowing Policy, and Governance Hotline.
Our Employees
OdysseyRe is committed to ensuring that our own workers are not being exploited, that they work in a safe
environment where all applicable laws are observed, and that there is no slavery or human trafficking in any part of
our business. All employees are made aware of our Whistleblowing Policy and Governance hotlines, and slavery and
human trafficking training programs are made available.
Our Commitment
This statement reflects OdysseyRe's commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all of our business
relationships, and to implementing and enforcing effective systems, controls and training as necessary to ensure
slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within OdysseyRe or in any of our supply chains. This statement is
available to all OdysseyRe employees, and will be reviewed at least annually.

Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement

This statement is pursuant of section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, and it sets out steps that Chandlers (Farm Equipment) Ltd are taking to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not present in any part of our business, or supply chains.
We are a family company with depots in Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Bedfordshire. We retail agricultural machinery, horticultural machinery, and cars, for which we have service and parts departments, and we also run country stores at five of our seven sites.
We are totally opposed to and have a zero tolerance of slavery and human trafficking. We are committed to acting ethically, with integrity and transparency in all of our business dealings, and relationships, and to implementing effective systems to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place anywhere within either our own business, or our suppliers businesses. In line with other major UK companies we have assessed risk relating to human trafficking and forced labour associated with our supply base. Our assessment is based upon geography, the commodity purchased and supplier quality performance. We sell high quality premium products from reputable suppliers predominantly in the UK and EU who uphold the same principles, and as such have assessed these suppliers as low risk, and therefore we do not presently consider that there is a need to conduct external audits on our suppliers and their factories. We are however committed to the continual improvement of our processes to effectively combat any concerns that may arise.
Our approach to slavery and human trafficking will be communicated to all suppliers, contractors and business partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and reinforced as appropriate thereafter.
All new employees are interviewed in person and original identity documents are checked before work commences. Payments are made to bank accounts in the employees own name and not a third party (where this is not possible it is only if approved by a director), and we endeavour to establish if there has been any third-party involvement.
The Company encourages anyone who has concern or suspicion of modern slavery or human trafficking in any part of our business, or our supply chain, to raise this with either the Company Secretary or Managing Director.
This statement will be reviewed by the Board of Directors on an annual basis and may be amended from time to time.
During the previous 12 months to the end of December 2018 (and at all times prior to this) no concerns have been raised with regard to suspicion of modern slavery or human trafficking in any part of our business or that of any of our suppliers. Our business activities have remained consistent and the board are satisfied that our policy and monitoring is thorough and would identify areas of concern if they existed that would then be investigated thoroughly.

4. Corporate Responsibility
sgfleet and Fleet Hire aspire to be regarded as a good corporate citizen with an awareness of its impact on the world we live in. Both sgf/eet and Fleet Hire have a desire to influence things for the better and minimise any adverse effects on the environment and social fabric flowing from their business operations. sgf/eet and Fleet Hire continuously strive to make good on this aspiration by improving and developing their practices. A core value for sgfleet and Fleet Hire is to conduct their businesses with honesty, integrity, dignity and respect and in an effort to maintain this core value each business will only seek to partner with organisations that have aligned values.
5. Policies and Procedures
sgfleet and Fleet Hire a establishing procedures to require any supplier to be contractually bound to abide to a Supplier Code of Conduct. At present, there are 2 Supplier Codes of Conduct (for each of sgf/eet and Fleet Hire) and both include covenants for suppliers to act ethically as well as specific requirements relating to the treatment of a supplier's employees. An internal team has been established to undertake a review of the business' contracts with its suppliers to ascertain which suppliers are not contracted to abide by the Supplier Code of Conduct and then to reverse this. Presently, sgfleet is updating the sgfleet Supplier Code of Conduct to specifically reference the prohibition of human trafficking and slavery. The Fleet Hire Supplier Code of Conduct already references this. sgfleet nor Fleet Hire are aware of any non-compliance with the requirements of the Supplier Code of Conduct by its suppliers and will not engage with a supplier that does not agree to adhere to, or demonstrate compliance withthe Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct also entitles sgfleet or Fleet Hire to request any information it reasonably requires to evaluate a supplier's compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct. Practically, sgfleet and Fleet Hire carry out due diligence on any new supplier and makes enquiries into that supplier's business practices and operations.
3

Enquiries are made of the supplier to demonstrate that its employees do not have: • excessive working hours; • unsafe work environments; • rates of pay below the minimum wage.
Further enquiries are made as how a supplier restricts (or not) a worker's freedom of movements and if there is a practice of confiscating passports.

6. Employees

sgf/eet has a Human Resource Manual which is properly followed and incorporated into the day to day operations of the businesses.

sgfleet and Fleet Hire have developed a consistent and mandatory approach to the training of its employees during the tenure of their employment such training topics include:

•

sgfleet policies;

• the laws and regulations of each State and Country that they are employed to work within.

Each employee is required to subscribe to the Employee Code of Conduct at the commencement of their employment. Employees are thoroughly inducted into the ethos, values and culture of sgf/eet to ensure that each employee is aware of their responsibilities and standard of behaviour. As part of an employee's induction they are required to complete mandatory training which includes subjects such as an expectation as to the standard of behavior of an employee both during their hours at work and also on social media outside of working hours.

A positive working culture is very important and of utmost priority to sgfleet and Fleet Hire.

Included as part of the Employee Code of Conduct are details of sgfleet's/F/eet Hire's whistleblower policy which notifies employees as to the procedures and protections given to any prospective whistleblower giving assurances that if they do utilise the whistleblower hotline they may do so without any fear of reprisal or dismissal.

sgf/eet and Fleet Hire consistently strive to deliver and demonstrate it commitment to living the values by demonstrating the values through behaviour and leadership.

Presently, sgfleet and Fleet Hire are updating its policies and procedures and the in house training provided to employees to specifically reference the prohibition of human trafficking and slavery and also to the Modern Slavery Helpline 0800 0121 700. Fleet Hire has already undertaken training on the Modern Slavery Act.

The policies and procedures give direction to employee on how to manage issues relevant to potential:

• conflicts of interest;

• discrimination;

• unsatisfactory workplace;

• inequity;

• negative reputational risks.

Before a new employee is hired, their work history, right to work in the United Kingdom and identification is verified for accuracy and/or authenticity.

4

Both sgfleet and Fleet Hire prefer to recruit their staff without the intervention of a third party supplier and has employed a dedicated in house recruitment consultant to manage the recruitment process. However, there are occasions when there is a need for staff to be recruited via third party supplier and this is undertaken only with recognised and reputable recruitment agencies.
7. Audit and ISO
The Australian business operations of sgfleet are certified to ISO 9001:2008. sgf/eet is working towards ISO 9001 certification for its United Kingdom business, whereas Fleet Hire has already obtained this certification. A dedicated in house Risk Officer and Auditor are employed by sgfleet to:
• (Auditor) evaluate the systemic operations of the business and identify areas for improvement in the areas of risk management, procedures and governance; and
• (Risk Officer) identify, assess, measure, manage, monitor and report risks.
8. Risk
sgf/eet and Fleet Hire consider that their trading activities and supply chains are at a low risk of attracting slavery and human trafficking. Regardless of the fact that both sgf/eet and Fleet Hire regard the risk of attracting human trafficking as low in its operations and supply chain, it nonetheless still has internal key performance indicators for staff performance so that employees are not incentivized for matters such as procuring services and products at the lowest cost and/or quickest lead times which may unwittingly lead to the exploitation of people.
9. Approval
This Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement has been approved by the board of directors of SG Fleet Group Limited and is made pursuant to s54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

221,"Modern Slavery Act Statement Slavery and Human Trafficking Transparency Statement for the Financial Year 2017 This Statement is made pursuant to Section 54 (Part 6) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (‘Act’) and sets out the steps that Morris Leisure has taken during the previous financial year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not operating within either its own business or its supply chains.
Company Overview Morris Leisure is a family owned company and part of the Paterson Enterprises Limited group.
Morris Leisure’s Philosophies and Principles Morris Leisure strives to ensure that it does not contribute towards adverse human rights impacts through its supply chains. There is an ongoing commitment to engage only those suppliers that uphold the same principles as Morris Leisure and where necessary ensure the implementation of corrective action measures. In the event that suppliers fail to take steps to cease or prevent adverse human rights impacts, Morris Leisure will reconsider its business relationships with those suppliers.
Morris Leisure’s activities in FY2017 related to prevention of slavery and human trafficking
Supply Chain Management Morris Leisure sources goods and services from suppliers based almost entirely in the United Kingdom. In all of its dealings with those suppliers it strives to ensure that the highest ethical standards are reached at all times. As part of this ongoing requirement, there has been increased focus on the requirement for a long term commitment by those suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their own businesses and supply chains.
Internal auditing An initial audit of all Morris Leisure has been completed and presents us with no immediate concerns. The vast majority of those suppliers are based in the United Kingdom and have been assessed as posing minimal risk in terms of non-compliance with the Act.
Morris Leisure’s continued commitment Morris Leisure recognises the importance of maintaining constant vigilance to identify and address any impacts associated with slavery and human trafficking throughout its supply chains. In recognition of the salience of these issues, Morris Leisure is committed to continuing to enhance its capacity to identify, prevent and mitigate any actual or potential impacts in this field.
Approval by Morris Leisure Limited Board of Directors I, Edward Goddard, hereby certify that the information contained in the above FY2017 Slavery and Human Trafficking Transparency Statement is factual and has been approved by the Morris Leisure Board of Directors.

Name: Edward Goddard Position: Managing Director, Morris Leisure Date: 15th September 2017

222,"HARIBO
Dunhills (Pontefract) PLC welcomes the requirements of Section 54 of the UK Modern
Slavery Act to understand all potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to
review and increase our preventative measures to ensure that there is no slavery or human
trafficking in its own organisation and its supply chains.
As part of the Sugar Confectionery Manufacturing supply chain, Haribo UK recognises that it
has a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human trafficking.
The organisation is absolutely committed to preventing any form of slavery and human
trafficking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from
slavery and human trafficking.
We measure our performance through key performance indicators (KPIs) and the goals that
we have set ourselves for 2017 are:
Requiring all staff to complete training on Stronger Together during their induction.
To successfully complete a full SMETA Audit at our UK sites during 2017.
3rd party audits to be conducted on any catering or hygiene organisation providing
outsourced labour to our UK sites.
We are committed to ensuring that all our first level suppliers are linked to us on
SEDEX and have a valid audit when required.
This statement relates to actions and activities during the financial year 1 January 2016 to
31 December 2016.
1.0
Organisational Structure and Supply Chains
This statement covers the activities of Dunhills (Pontefract) PLC, part of Haribo Holding
GmbH & Co. KG and is the largest sugar confectionery manufacturer with the brands Haribo
and MAOAM. We supply to all the major UK retailers, discounters and foodservice
customers. We have 2 manufacturing sites in the UK with 750 employees and at most 30
additional temporary workers at peak holiday times.
2.0
High Risk Activities
The following activities are considered to be at high risk of slavery or human trafficking:
1. As a food manufacturer, the industry is known to have a heavy reliance on
temporary agency labour. Whilst we have a minimal number of colleagues on this
form of contract and therefore our risk is greatly reduced, we appreciate that this
will be a common issue to other organisations within our supply chain.
2. Raw Materials and packaging where farming or mining exists (Gelatine, Sugar,
Glucose, Palm Oil as examples) are known to be at risk from the use of slavery. Our
Group Procurement team ensure that suppliers are selected based on their
suitability and historical performance. All suppliers are encouraged to register with
SEDEX and are required to sign up to the group managed Supplier Code of Conduct.
3. Reports show that Modern Slavery within the construction industry is high risk.
Haribo UK only uses reputable contractors all of whom go through an approval
process managed by the Facilities team
4. Any supplier, especially further down the supply chain where we do not have direct
management control.
3.0
Risk Assessment
The risk of slavery and human trafficking 'within' our organisation we believe is mitigated as
a result of strict policies and good practices within our operations and the knowledge and
skills of our colleagues.
Good Practices already embedded within Haribo UK's sites:
Stronger Together
Stronger Together training carried out by all HR colleagues
Procurement colleagues' attendance at Stronger Together workshops
Posters displayed on all sites in multiple languages
Payroll checks on addresses and bank accounts
Every colleague joining the business attends an induction where Modern
Slavery is discussed and what someone should do if they feel it affects them
Agency
All agencies that supply to us hold the appropriate GLA licence
All workers via agency are paid at the correct rate of pay for the role that
they are contracted to carry out
SEDEX
Haribo Holding GmbH & Co. KG has made a commitment that all its
manufacturing sites will have an ethical audit.
The UK sites will have their first audit in November 2017
That we have a pro-active response to this audit and put in place plans that
will address any recommendations that are raised
Employees
We have a recognition agreement with the GMB and we proactively work
together on the issues of Modern Slavery and human trafficking.
We have attended workshops together hosted by Wakefield Police on the
matters of this statement
Dignity at Work - all employees and workers are expected to work with
integrity and respect for each other. Colleagues receive training in Dignity at
Work and are free to raise any issues of concern direct to their management
team on site or through their Trade Union Rep
We have a communication forum which is to encourage all our colleagues to
feel that they have a voice and can be heard
We undertake Employee Engagement surveys and develop actions plans to
implement changes as a result of these.
The standards set out above are under the responsibility of the Head of HR.
We consider the greatest risk of slavery and human trafficking is in our supply chain where
we undertake procurement activities and where operations and managerial oversight are
out of our direct control.
Through our Supplier Code of conduct, Haribo UK is committed to ensuring that its suppliers
adhere to the highest standards of ethics. Suppliers are required to demonstrate that they
provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and act ethically
and within the law in their use of labour. We work with suppliers to ensure that they meet
the standards of the agreement and improve their worker's working conditions. However,
serious violations of our Supplier Code of conduct may lead to the termination of the
business relationship.
Suppliers, where possible, are expected to be members of SEDEX and show full visibility of
any ethical audits.
4.0
Due Diligence
Our Procurement team undertake a due diligence exercise when considering taking on new
suppliers, and regularly reviews its existing suppliers. These include:
mapping the supply chain broadly to assess particular product or geographical risks
of modern slavery and human trafficking;
reviewing on a regular basis all aspects of the supply chain based on the supply chain
mapping;
conducting supplier audits or assessments through SEDEX, which have a greater
degree of focus on slavery and human trafficking where general risks are identified;
creating an annual risk profile for each supplier;
taking steps to improve substandard suppliers' practices, including providing advice
to suppliers through SEDEX and requiring them to implement action plans;
Modern Slavery Statement",?
223,"Modern Slavery and Anti Human Trafficking Policy
and Disclosure Statement
The Marshalls group of companies (which includes Marshalls plc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, referred to in this Statement as “Marshalls”), wherever it operates around the world, is committed to conducting business with honesty and integrity; in treating all people with dignity and respect and in complying with applicable laws, regulations and treaties. Marshalls is also committed to protecting and promoting human rights globally. Marshalls does not tolerate child labour, forced labour, including prison labour, or any use of force or other forms of coercion, fraud, deception, abuse of power or other means to achieve control over another person for the purpose of exploitation.
Marshalls respects international principles of human rights including, but not limited to, those expressed in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, United Nations Global Compact Principles, Children's Rights and Business Principles, Women's Empowerment Principles and those principles contained within the UK Government Modern Slavery Act 2015. These principles and commitments will be embodied in Marshalls’ Procurement Code of Conduct. Marshalls complies with the employment laws of every country in which it operates and expects those with whom it does business to do the same. Marshalls also complies with national and international laws governing supply chain management and expects those with whom it does business to do the same. Marshalls’ Procurement Code of Conduct specifies supplier obligations regarding modern slavery and human trafficking. In 2016 Marshalls will: make all existing tier one suppliers aware of its Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy and Disclosure Statement; provide and promote clear online supplier guidance in its ‘Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking; Marshalls Procurement Code of Conduct’ booklet; and incorporate clear instructions within its’ Procurement Code of Conduct regarding modern slavery and human trafficking to ensure that suppliers understand the standards that the organisation applies.

The UK Government Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires Marshalls to disclose annually online, as a minimum, the following:
I. The organisation’s structure, its business and its supply chains; II. Its policies in relation to slavery and human trafficking; III. Its due diligence processes in relation to slavery and human trafficking in its business and
supply chains; IV. The parts of its business and supply chains where there is a risk of slavery and human
trafficking taking place, and the steps it has taken to assess and manage that risk; V. Its effectiveness in ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its
business or supply chains, measured against such performance indicators as it considers appropriate. VI. The training available to its staff involved in supply chain management and employees throughout the rest of the organisation.

I.

The organisation’s structure, its business and its supply chains:

Marshalls’ sustainability business model incorporates the organisation’s commitments as a United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) signatory and engagement in the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership laid out by the UNGC. The three pillars of sustainability; economic, environmental and social, continue to provide the focus for our activity. These are underpinned by the UNGC principles of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Our brand values of leadership, excellence, trust and sustainability empower employees to ‘do the right thing’ by leveraging sustainability to drive competitive advantage for our business.

The organisation’s ongoing inclusion, for over ten years, in the FTSE4Good Index, designed to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong environmental, social and governance practices, is vindication of Marshalls’ continual efforts to meet and seek to exceed globally recognised corporate responsibility standards.

The following illustrates how we operate:

The following shows how we seek to add value:
Marshalls classifies its suppliers in the following manner: 1) Goods for resale, e.g. natural stone and paving. 2) Direct materials, e.g. aggregates, sand and cement. 3) Indirect purchases; consumables and services, e.g. engineering supplies, canteen, and cleaning services.

Since 2005 Marshalls has had a programme of ongoing assessment regarding areas of high risk related to its supply chain. Internal processes and procedures allow us to clearly identify high risk supply chains and/or areas within our supply chains where there is an increased risk of modern slavery, therefore our current primary area of focus involves Goods for Resale specifically from India, China and Vietnam.
Stage 1: Initial Desk-based Due Diligence Report referencing published data from sources including, but not limited to: International Peace Index Global Observatory, Human Rights Watch Global Report, Human Rights Monitor, Universal Human Rights Index Database, Amnesty International Annual Report, Transparency International’s Corruption Index, Children’s Rights and Business Atlas, Gender Inequality Index, Social Institutions and Gender Index, The Global Slavery Index, ITUC Global Rights Index and the International Labour Organisation.
Stage 2: Initial Supplier Visit and Audit against United Nations Global Compact Principles – Human Rights; Labour; Environment; Anti-Corruption; https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-isgc/mission/principles – and the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code; http://www.ethicaltrade.org/resources/eti-base-code.
Stage 3: Third Party Auditing Visit and Report resulting in a clear corrective action plan if necessary.
Stage 4: Detailed Human Rights Impact Assessment report which is then incorporated into ongoing updates, internal briefings, and corrective action plans, etc.
Assessment for Goods for Resale is therefore undertaken in stages resulting in a ‘go/no-go’ protocol. It is based primarily upon adherence to the UNGC Principles, implementation of the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code and a clear Human Rights Impact Assessment Programme.
As previously mentioned, the organisation’s current focus is upon Goods for Resale from India, China and Vietnam. Further planned activity will also look in detail at ‘Goods for Resale’ in both Europe and the UK, as well as goods classified as Direct Materials and Indirect Purchases. All and any areas identified as high risk in the meantime will be treated as a priority by the organisation.

Marshalls complies with all applicable trade laws. Marshalls’ Procurement Code of Conduct clearly communicates the requirement that suppliers must comply with laws governing human trafficking and slavery and reserves Marshalls’ right to immediately investigate any discovered instances of noncompliance with the Procurement Code of Conduct.
Marshalls has a process for the ongoing management/verification of its supply chains which seeks to evaluate and to address risks of human trafficking and slavery in all areas of procurement. These include: the organisation’s Procurement Code of Conduct; regular audits - announced and unannounced - undertaken by third party organisations; regular - announced and unannounced supply chain evaluation by Marshalls’ sustainability team; human rights impact assessments programme; bi-annual children's rights and business principles audits; Human Rights Compliance Assessment checks; weekly social auditor reports from high risk supply chains; and NGO and IGO research on the supply chain and the wider sector.
II. Policies in relation to slavery and human trafficking;
Marshalls already has audit rights in a many of its supply contracts, which permit the organisation to audit a supplier’s compliance under the terms of the contract, and expects to extend this to encompass audits in relation to modern slavery. While Marshalls has certain contractual rights to audit its suppliers, and has conducted routine audits or assessments of supplier performance, those assessment methodologies do not currently include intentional assessments of human trafficking and slavery but will do by the end of 2017. Marshalls has reserved the right to investigate instances of non-compliance with our Procurement Code of Conduct, including instances of non-compliance with laws governing human trafficking and modern slavery.
All Marshalls’ contracts with suppliers require suppliers to comply with all applicable laws. Marshalls’ suppliers are also required to adhere to the Procurement Code of Conduct, which states the requirement of compliance with laws and ethical business conduct, including those laws and principles prohibiting involvement in human trafficking and slavery. When a supplier accepts our purchase order and/or enters into a contract with Marshalls, they are acknowledging and consenting to comply with all laws and with our Procurement Code of Conduct. Other than these contractual obligations with suppliers and Marshalls’ reservation of right to investigate, Marshalls does not have a formal supplier certification process.

The following policies, statements and codes of conduct should be read in conjunction with this Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement and area available online at http://www.marshalls.co.uk/our-policies : Anti-Bribery Policy; Human Rights Policy; Children's Rights Policy; Social Investment Policy.
In additions readers should look at the Annual Report 2015 and the UNGC Communication on Progress Report 2015.
Internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking: Marshalls’ employees are, under the terms of their employment, expected to follow all laws of the countries in which they operate and all of the organisation’s policies, including the Marshalls Employee Code of Conduct. Employees who violate laws or policies are subject to disciplinary action which in certain cases can lead to dismissal.
Marshalls' suppliers are subject to the terms of all contracts with the organisation, including obligations to comply with the Procurement Code of Conduct. Marshalls reserves its contractual rights to terminate relationships with suppliers who fail to comply with law and/or whose contractual noncompliance is not addressed in a timely manner. A supplier’s compliance with the Procurement Code of Conduct is an essential factor in Marshalls’ decision whether to enter into, continue or extend existing business relationships with that supplier.
III. Due diligence processes in relation to slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains;
Due diligence processes regarding modern slavery and human trafficking are embedded throughout our procurement due diligence process;
Stage 1: Initial Desk-based Due Diligence Report Stage 2: Initial Supplier Visit and Audit Stage 3: Third Party Auditing Visit and Reporting Stage 4: Detailed Human Rights Impact Assessment and Ongoing Human Rights Programme
In 2017 Marshalls will report back, within its disclosure statement, against each of these stages in relation to all of the countries from which it sources. This will include all of its procedures and processes regarding supply chain management.

IV. The parts of its business and supply chains where there is a risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place, and the steps it has taken to assess and manage that risk;
As previously stated, Marshalls classifies its suppliers as follows: 1) Goods for resale, e.g. natural stone and paving. 2) Direct materials, e.g. aggregates, sand and cement. 3) Indirect purchases; consumables and services, e.g. engineering supply, canteen, cleaning.
Internal processes and procedures allow us to clearly identify high risk supply chains and/or areas within our supply chains where there is an increased risk of modern slavery. It should be noted that Marshalls’ default position is to source from suppliers where we are able to trace back to the raw material.
During 2016/17 Marshalls will map its activities in relation to these three classification areas; further identify high risk areas within its business and supply chain; communicate developments in procedures; together with appropriate third parties develop a protocol which responds to the needs of victims of modern slavery, and report transparently on any and all instances of modern slavery identified within its business and supply chains.
V) Its effectiveness in ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its business or supply chains, measured against such performance indicators as it considers appropriate.
Marshalls is working to support the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner’s efforts to identify and eradicate modern slavery and human trafficking in order to ensure that individuals do not suffer as victims and that Marshalls does not become a corporate victim of modern slavery and human trafficking. The organisation is doing this by;
 Undertaking an internal awareness campaign throughout the organisation involving all employees regarding modern slavery; what it is, who it affects and why it matters to Marshalls.
 Ensuring that all relevant employees involved directly in supply chains and procurement undertake training regarding modern slavery.
 Ensuring that all suppliers have received and understood Marshalls’ position regarding modern slavery via an independent auditing process.
 Actively developing its due diligence, human rights programme and external auditing process in relation to identified high risk areas within its supply chain.

 Engaging appropriately with a wide range of stakeholders to help ensure that we can further refine and develop our activity in this area; for example, third sector partners, the UN, government, customers, civil society, and young people.
 Monitoring of all related activity using UNGC Principles and the ETI Base Code.  Revising its Procurement Code of Conduct.
Marshalls will report against all of these activities in its 2017 disclosure statement.
VI) The training available to its staff working in supply chain management, those in the rest of the organisation, and suppliers.
All suppliers, both existing and new, are required to undertake Marshalls’ online training module regarding issues of legal compliance, including modern slavery and human trafficking. Additional supplier education activity has been extended to include modern slavery and human trafficking and will be fully developed and implemented during 2016. This activity will include: education workshops; online training; face-to-face meetings; newsletters; road shows; conferences; emails; social media; public relations and communications activity.
Existing and new employees directly involved in procurement, human resources and the supply chain will be required to undertake training regarding issues of legal compliance, including modern slavery and human trafficking. Marshalls regularly trains its employees in the standards of ethical behaviour, human rights, children's rights, child labour, modern slavery and human trafficking, related policies, procedures and legal requirements. All of this is done within a framework of our brand values of leadership, excellence, trust and sustainability which ensures that the organisation clearly establishes the manner in which we conduct business. All employees will be trained at induction about our policies regarding modern slavery and trafficking within a sustainability, ethical business and human rights context.
Marshalls is in the process of developing, in conjunction with the Global Compact Network UK, a Certificate in Sustainability which will be open to all employees as part of their Continuous Professional and Personal Development programme. This Certificate includes human rights and specifically addresses modern slavery and human trafficking, children's rights, child labour and gender issues, with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chain.

During 2016, and periodically thereafter, Marshalls will undertake an internal awareness campaign regarding modern slavery and communicating the messages referenced in the Home Office campaign ‘Slavery is Closer Than You Think’. This internal awareness campaign will include posters throughout the organisation’s UK-based operations, board briefings, briefing of the marketing team, briefing of the procurement team, briefing of works/facilities managers, face-to-face meetings with key individuals, specific human resources and procurement team training, modern slavery online courses available to all employees and a Modern Slavery app on all company mobile phones.
In addition supply chain and sourcing directors, managers and employees, departmental directors and board directors will receive quarterly high level briefings on human rights issues including modern slavery and human trafficking. They are also required to undertake the training programme regarding modern slavery and human trafficking.
Marshalls’ current annual UNGC Communication on Progress should also be viewed together with this statement. Marshalls will update and publish this Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement annually.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement

Cargill provides food, agriculture, financial and industrial products and services to the world. We have 155,000 employees in 70 countries who are committed to feeding the world in a responsible way, reducing environmental impact and improving the communities where we live and work.
Cargill is committed to treating people with dignity and respect in the workplace and in the communities where we do business, as well as to the respect and protection of human rights. We are passionate about our goal to be the global leader in nourishing people and operating responsibly across the agricultural, food, industrial and financial markets we serve.
Code of Conduct
Since our company was founded in 1865, we have acted on the belief that doing the right thing sets the foundation for long-term success. Cargill’s Code of Conduct outlines our company’s ethical and compliance standards for conducting business throughout the world. Our Code is grounded in our seven Guiding Principles, which are ingrained in our culture and serve as the foundation for the behaviours expected from all of our employees in all parts of the world. Every employee receives an introduction to the Code of Conduct and Guiding Principles, which is followed by regular training to help ensure that employees’ actions align with the company’s commitments on business conduct, the environment, people and communities.
Operating responsible supply chains
We believe responsible supply chains must respect people and human rights, promote good agricultural practices, provide viable livelihoods, reduce environmental impacts, treat animals humanely, and produce safe and wholesome food.
We do not accept or support the use of illegal, abusive, enforced or child labour. We abide by the laws in the countries where we operate and often exceed applicable local, state and national laws and regulations regarding employment and the employment of minors. We believe it is essential that all parties in the supply chain – industry, government and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) – work together to address this complex problem and support rural livelihoods, raise incomes and ensure children and adults are not subject to these conditions.
We are taking actions in our supply chains to prevent and address illegal, abusive or forced work, which include:
Cocoa – as part of our Cargill Cocoa Promise we are committed to working to protect the rights of children, to raise awareness of labour issues and improve working practices through training and education, for farmers and their communities, and to take action to prevent children being put at risk
Soy – our commitment to responsible soy production includes being a signatory to the Brazilian National Pact for the Eradication of Slave Labor, which monitors suppliers. We will not do business with those who appear on this list.
Palm – Cargill has deployed a global palm policy and we are working towards a 100% transparent, traceable and

sustainable palm supply chain by 2020, including strict criteria for fair labor rights and human rights. As a member of the Round Table on Sustainable Oil (RSPO), our palm plantations are RSPO certified and we offer RSPO certified palm oil products to our customers.
Cotton – we are committed to supporting the work being done by governments and organizations like the Association of Cotton Merchants in Europe and the International Labor Organization to find practical solutions to labour issues while fostering responsible economic development.
Poultry – we comply with all legal requirements surrounding employee rights, health and safety, ethical responsibilities and human trafficking.
Aquaculture Feed – we comply with all legal requirements surrounding employee rights, health and safety and ethical responsibilities. Within our supply chain, we inform suppliers of these issues and the standards we expect them to meet.
Cargill is a member of Sedex, which promotes improvements in ethical and responsible business practices and we make information about our businesses and facilities available to customers through this widely used and recognised system.
Raising grievances
We take all reports of potential misconduct seriously and handle them promptly, fairly, and as confidentially as possible. We have established a transparent, open, and predictable process for dealing with grievances. Any grievance, complaint or concern from external parties and employees may be submitted anonymously online or by phone via Cargill’s secure Ethics Open Line, which is operated by an independent third-party and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Employees can also raise grievances with their manager, human resources representative, and/or through their trade union or employee representative. Cargill will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who, in good faith, raises a concern or participates in an investigation.
This Statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and has been approved by the Board of Directors of Cargill PLC.

226,"MODERN SLAVERY ACT STATEMENT
A. Our business and supply chains
This statement is made on behalf of HPI UK Holding Ltd trading as Rosewood London (""The Hotel""). HPI UK Holding Ltd is the ownership company of Rosewood London which is a luxury hotel in central London, England. The hotel is managed by Rosewood Hotel Group on behalf of HPI UK Holding Ltd. Rosewood Hotel Group is an international luxury hotel and resort company currently operating 19 properties in 11 countries, owned by Hong Kong-based New World Development. The Hotel has over 500 employees in the UK. The Hotel had an annual turnover in 2016 of £44.5 million. The Hotel is based at one site, in central London, United Kingdom. The Hotel provides full hotel services including bedrooms, spa and leisure facilities with significant food and beverage offerings. Our supply chains include purchases of food and beverages as well as operating supplies and services for all areas of our business. The majority of supply of goods and services is from UKbased companies. This statement is made on behalf of HPI only pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes HPI's slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31st December 2018.
B. Our commitment
The Hotel is committed to ensuring that it conducts its business ethically and with integrity. The Hotel does not use slave labour anywhere in its own business, nor does The Hotel tolerate forced or compulsory labour or human trafficking. The Hotel is committed to ensuring that no such behaviour takes place in connection with the company. This commitment extends to The Hotel’s supply chain. The Hotel's supplier relationships are based on lawful, efficient and fair practices. We expect our suppliers to obey the laws that require them to treat workers fairly and provide a safe and healthy work environment. The Hotel will not knowingly use any supplier that uses forced, prison, or indentured labour. The Hotel will only work with suppliers who comply with all laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which the suppliers are doing business.
C. Our policy
We take a risk-based approach to performing due diligence on our suppliers, which includes especially reviewing suppliers doing business in high-risk countries or offering high-risk products or services. Based upon this risk, certain suppliers will be completing a Modern Slavery Survey in the 1st quarter of 2018 and we will conduct ongoing due diligence on certain of our existing and prospective suppliers. To the extent that if a supplier does not meet our due diligence requirements or our standards for ethical conduct, we will not do business with that supplier.

The organisation uses only specified, reputable employment agencies to source agency labour and always verifies the practices of any new agency it is using before accepting workers from that agency.
D. Risks
In order to identify and address risks of Modern Slavery in our supply chain we will: • Carry out a first tier risk supplier mapping exercise in order to identify suppliers that fall within an area that is at high risk of Modern Slavery, and address Modern Slavery with these suppliers by requesting copies of their policies and procedures together with a survey. • Address Modern Slavery as a formal business risk that will be reviewed at quarterly meetings and owned by Executives within the business. • Review our procurement processes to identify Modern Slavery as a risk to be identified and assessed on supplier audits. • Ensured our Right to Work policy is followed with strict compliance.
E. Conducting business
The Hotel implements the above policies and the commitment set out in this statement by requiring all of its suppliers to certify that they are compliant with the terms of the same as well as incorporating such compliance in the terms of our purchase orders. Further, The Hotel contractually obliges its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and to adopt compliant working practices, including not utilising any form of compulsory labour or human trafficking. The Hotel’s suppliers are obliged to pass these requirements on to their own suppliers as well, and The Hotel expects all of its suppliers to police their own supply chains in order to root out modern slavery of any kind. Suppliers that fail to meet the contractual requirements set forth above will be no longer be used. In addition, key personnel in The Hotel’s procurement department receive training on how to identify human trafficking and forced labour issues. The Hotel encourages anyone with information regarding modern slavery or human trafficking taking place at the company or anywhere in its supply chain to make a report directly to the company's Managing Director.
F. Tracking and monitoring
We intend to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains by surveying at least 25% of our suppliers each year.

227,"SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT for the year ended 31 December 2018
Approved by the Board on 18 June 2019 Published June 2019
INTRODUCTION
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Atrium Underwriters Ltd (“AUL”) slavery and human trafficking statement for the current financial year. It will be reviewed annually.
AUL’s business model and supply chain represent a low risk of exposure to slavery and human trafficking.
AUL operates under a code of business principles and ethics and does not accept any breach of human rights including slavery and human trafficking. The code is Board approved and this statement is aligned with the principles set out in the code. As a business we raise awareness with our staff to be alert to the risk, however remote, that we might become party to either slavery or human trafficking in our business and in the wider supply chain.
OUR POLICY ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We are seeking to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking, as defined in the Modern Slavery Act 2015, in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our business principles and ethics statement reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We have implemented and enforce effective and proportionate systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not accepted anywhere in our supply chains.
Organisational Structure AUL is a long established leading specialist insurance and reinsurance business, underwriting through Syndicate 609 at Lloyd’s. We are based in London and we have offices in the US and Canada. Atrium operates as part of a group of companies whose UK parent company is Atrium Underwriting Group Ltd (“AUGL”). Our staff and services are all employed through a group company, Atrium Group Services Ltd (“AGSL”). AUL, AUGL and AGSL are all covered by this statement.
OUR SUPPLY CHAINS
When considering our supply chains we focus on those firms who we pay for provision of goods and services. We source our insurance business through a range of worldwide brokers and placement of business to the syndicate will usually involve a Lloyd’s broker. These brokers derive their income from the client (the (re)insured), as such we do not consider our brokers to be a part of our supply chain in this context. That said we will only deal with reputable firms who are regulated by a local insurance regulator. This regulation will typically include an assessment of their fitness and propriety.
Page 1 of 2

We also underwrite (re)insurance business through Lloyd’s approved Coverholders located globally (most significantly in the UK, EU, US, Canada, Australia and South Africa). These firms act as our agents. As part of our due diligence performed when taking on a new coverholder we make an assessment of the likely exposure to slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which they will operate and seek assurance where relevant.
For certain activities we retain outsourced service providers to administer our affairs (e.g. claims handling, loss adjusting, policy processing) or provide outsourced support functions (e.g. investment management). We amended our Outsourcing Policy to recognise the need for an assessment of the risk of exposure to possible slavery or human trafficking and we require commentary on how this risk is mitigated as part of the due diligence process prior to approval of material service providers.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
As part of our supply chain assessment undertaken to identify and mitigate risk –
• We review our list of suppliers and outsourced providers and assess the risk they pose to our business
• We review our list of coverholders and risk assess them by country focusing on those operating in countries where slavery or trafficking is seen as a significant risk and understand whether there is a potential for exposure
TRAINING
To ensure the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business are understood by our staff, we provide training and raise awareness using our intranet. We also provide awareness training to new recruits during their induction period.
OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN COMBATING SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We may use key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains but given the limited number of counterparties it may be more effective to consider each one individually. Appropriate commentary will be made available to the board to support the sign off of future statements.

231,"Modern Slavery Act Statement for the financial year 2016
Introduction
This statement, which has been approved by the Board of Directors, is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”) and sets out the steps the Company has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our business.
Slavery and human trafficking is a hidden blight on our global society. We all have a responsibility to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. Our colleagues are expected to report concerns and management are expected to act upon them.
Our Business
Machine Mart Ltd (trading as “Machine Mart”) is a retailer of Power Tools and Machinery trading through its nationwide superstores, as well as its Telesales and website.
Our Supply Chains
We source our products from UK based suppliers as well as European suppliers in a number of countries. In all of its dealing with these suppliers Machine Mart strive to ensure that the highest ethical standards are met.
As part of this ongoing obligation, we have conducted an audit on our suppliers by asking them to confirm that there will be an increased focus by them to eradicate any slavery and human trafficking in their own businesses and their supply chain and asking them to confirm that they, in turn have conducted an audit on their immediate supply chain.
Our Policies on Slavery & Human Trafficking
Machine Mart is committed to supporting international efforts to promote ethical principles and practices related to the prevention of the exploitation and abuse associated with modern slavery and human trafficking as defined in the Modern Day Slavery Act 2015.
Our Anti-Slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
Due Diligence Process for Slavery & Human Trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we:
• Where possible, build long standing relationships with local suppliers and make clear our expectations of business behaviour;
• With regards to international supply chains, our point of contact is preferably with a UK company or agent and we expect these entities to have suitable antislavery and human trafficking policies and processes.

• We have in place systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistle blowers.
As part of our commitment Machine Mart has requested (and will continue to request): - Written undertakings from all suppliers in order to satisfy itself of their ongoing ability to comply with the Act both in regards to their own activities, and also that of their supply chain.
- We have also updated our Terms and Conditions of trading for any new suppliers to ensure their relevance and compliance with the Act.
Training Our training programme for buyers has been updated to include their understanding of how suppliers can meet their compliance with the Act and how they can play an active part in evaluating and monitoring, in order to mitigate the risks within the supply chain. We have also trained our key staff in Modern Slavery and human rights and then used them to support each business area in meeting their obligations of the Modern Slavery Act. Effectiveness in Combating Slavery & Human Trafficking As part of their discussions and negotiations with current and potential suppliers, our buyers will in future ask questions of each supplier to ensure they are compliant or confirm what steps are being taken to ensure compliance with the Act by that supplier and further down their own supply chains. Where required, further audits or documentary evidence will be requested from certain suppliers to ensure that they are compliant with the Act.

Ingenico Group – Modern Slavery Statement

We recognise that slavery in all of its forms, including servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking (Modern Slavery) continues to be a serious issue and we are fully supportive of efforts to eradicate these abhorrent crimes. This
statement sets out the steps that we have taken to eliminate the risk of Modern Slavery taking place in our organisation and in our supply chain.

INGENICO GROUP STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY CHAIN OVERVIEW
Ingenico Group SA, a French publicly listed company, is the parent of the Ingenico group of companies (“Ingenico Group”) including the main trading entity in the UK, Ingenico (UK) Limited (“Ingenico UK”). Ingenico Group is the global leader in seamless payment services, providing secure payment solutions across all sales channels. The Group is organised across two customer-centric business units – the Retail Business Unit and the Banks and Acquirers Business Unit. Ingenico Group employs over 8,000 people located in 41 countries. It has commercial operations in 170 countries, with sales revenues in 2017 of €2, 510m.
As a global organisation, acting with integrity in all of our business activities is of paramount importance. We strive to maintain the highest ethical standards in all engagements with our various stakeholders. In particular we are committed to working only with suppliers and service providers who conduct business in a socially responsible manner. The most significant supply chain operations relate to the manufacturing of payment terminals, which is an activity that is almost exclusively outsourced. This process is managed centrally by Ingenico Group and the payment terminals are then distributed to regional entities including Ingenico UK.
The assembly of the payment terminals is carried out by approved subcontractors who have been thoroughly evaluated and are regularly audited. Upstream from this assembly chain, Ingenico Group works with a community of suppliers to produce its various components. These product manufacturing and assembly activities are predominantly carried out in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Brazil.
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Ingenico Group’s adherence to ethical working practices is demonstrated by its participation in the UN Global Compact . Each year, as a signatory to the Global Compact Ingenico Group reports on the progress it has made in respecting and promoting the Global Compact’s universal principles, including in relation to human rights and international labour standards. In 2017, the Group decided to publish its report at GC Advanced level, which corresponds to a higher standard of social responsibility.
Our commitment to ensuring that there is no Modern Slavery in our supply chains or in any part of our business is also enshrined in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct , which is made available to all employees and states:
“Ingenico will not tolerate the use of forced or compulsory labour within its Group or by any of its service providers or suppliers, i.e. workers employed by coercion, force or blackmail.”

Ingenico Group launched the review of its Code of Ethics and Business Conduct in 2017, particularly in connection with the UK Modern Slavery Act and other recent regulations.
The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is accessible in multiple languages to ensure that the Group’s ethical culture is fully understood and adopted by all parts of the business. The global Human Resources network also ensures that ethical working standards are consistently applied across the business. This is supported by the Internal Control Manual and internal auditors verify compliance and ensure there are no abnormal situations, such as employees not receiving minimum wages or more people working on sites than there should be. Additionally, Ingenico Group operates a whistle-blowing mechanism, which can be used by any employee or external stakeholder to report any breach or potential breach of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.
Our rigorous approach to maintaining ethical business practices is further underlined by the existence of a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) function, who are responsible for managing the Group’s CSR activities. The CSR policy includes specific commitments regarding labour rights and social justice standards.
SUPPLIER DUE DILIGENCE, CONTRACTUAL CONTROLS AND AUDITS
We consider that our biggest exposure to Modern Slavery risks is in our product supply chains. This is due to the component manufacturing and assembly activities being undertaken by suppliers and also because some of the locations where such suppliers are based are considered to be higher risk. For this reason, we implement a range of due diligence measures to assess and manage any risks of Modern Slavery within these supply chains:
Suppliers are required to comply with our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. These standards are enforced by contractual mechanisms and should the supplier fail to comply, Ingenico will exercise its rights, including termination of the supplier contractual relationship. Ingenico Group’s two main assembly subcontractors have signed the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. This commits participants to uphold the human rights of workers and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community. These standards apply to all workers including temporary, migrant, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker. A Supplier Quality Agreement is routinely entered into by component suppliers. This agreement states: “Employment should be freely chosen. Under no circumstances will the supplier make use of forced or bonded labour […] to design, manufacture or assemble components.” Additionally, component suppliers are requested to sign a CSR Supplier Agreement to commit them to socially responsible practices including the prevention of involuntary labour and human trafficking, and cascade the Group’s conditions down their own supply chains. Any failure to comply with the forced labour and anti-slavery prohibitions in a CSR Supplier Agreement will allow Ingenico to terminate its relationship with that supplier. Dedicated teams from Ingenico Group are based at the main assembly sites to continuously monitor production activity. In 2017, more than 20 audits were carried out on these sites. For electronic component suppliers, Ingenico Group ensures close supervision and performs regular audits, including evaluation of CSR practices. Audits are also conducted when considering new suppliers or when initiating new projects. In relation to the 108 components suppliers that were active in 2017, 64 quality audits were carried out and 90% had either agreed to comply with the CSR agreement or demonstrated RBA membership. Specific actions (which may include onsite audits) are taken with suppliers who are not RBA members and have not signed a CSR agreement, to understand the blocking points (which may not be related to Modern Slavery) and to analyse and address the associated risks. A detailed CSR assessment questionnaire is used in conjunction with audits to evaluate the supplier’s policies and controls relating to CSR issues. A particular assessment point relates to whether the supplier has a written policy, endorsed by its senior management, covering freely chosen employment, avoidance of child labour, working hours, wages and benefits and humane treatment of all employees. This assessment questionnaire will be sent to all critical suppliers in 2018 and forms an integral part of Ingenico’s CSR control process. Our supply chain is periodically assessed on conflict minerals presence to ensure that the minerals that go into our terminal components do not benefit armed groups that violate human rights. In 2017, this assessment was carried out in close collaboration with one of Ingenico Group’s assembly subcontractors using the reporting tool provided by the RMI (Responsible Minerals Initiative) and information was obtained from 99% of suppliers of the components used in Ingenico terminals.
Although we consider that the main Modern Slavery risks relate to component manufacturing activities, we are aware of the need to remain vigilant in all supply chain operations. Procurement not related to the core manufacturing products (e.g. logistics, courier services, waste management etc.) is controlled at a local business level. Prior to use of any significant new suppliers by Ingenico UK a due diligence questionnaire, including an ethics section and a question on employment of child or forced labour, must be satisfactorily completed. Ingenico UK also conducted onsite audits in 2017 for 4 of the 6 key suppliers

forced labour, must be satisfactorily completed. Ingenico UK also conducted onsite audits in 2017 for 4 of the 6 key suppliers to verify compliance with our requirements, including legal and ethical standards.
TRAINING AND AWARENESS
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of Modern Slavery in our business, we provide training to our staff. Since 2015, a comprehensive training course on our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct has been rolled out across all business units and made accessible online via the Ingenico University platform. This training includes a section on forced labour, coercive practices, unpaid work and wages below legal standards and emphasis that these practices would not be tolerated. It also provides details on how to confidentially report any non-compliance and clarifies that those reporting issues would be fully protected.
In 2017, an overview of the Modern Slavery Act was provided to the global legal and compliance community, to help raise awareness of Modern Slavery issues among key stakeholders across Ingenico Group. An awareness session was also provided to the Ingenico UK management board.
FURTHER STEPS
Our commitment to preventing slavery and human trafficking is demonstrated by ensuring the continuous review and improvement of our systems and processes. This includes reviewing our existing controls, policies and procedures from a Modern Slavery perspective and considering what changes may be appropriate.
As part of this commitment, Ingenico Group has recently developed two new processes that will be implemented in the course of 2018:
Assessing the potential risks of modern slavery in our supply chain by mapping our suppliers according to specific criteria contained within internal and externally-published resources (e.g. the Global Slavery Index) in order to review feedback from our suppliers highlighting potential risk factors including, but not limited to the supplier’s country of operation and the percentage levels of manual labour vs. automated operations; and The integration of new social criteria into our suppliers’ audit processes including indicators related to Modern Slavery, such as maximum number of weekly working hours, minimum age of the employees and respect of minimum wages, all as accounted for under regional law and regulations applicable to each local Ingenico entity.
Further steps to be implemented may include:
Update our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct to further reinforce our commitment to combat Modern Slavery; and Review our existing controls, policies and procedures from a Modern Slavery perspective and consider what changes may be appropriate;
We will report on progress made in future statements.
This statement is made on behalf of Ingenico Group SA and its relevant subsidiaries, including Ingenico (UK) Limited, pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our Group's slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2017.

Modern Slavery and human trafficking statement for financial year ending 30 September 2018 Slavery and human trafficking statement as required under s54, Part 6, of the Modern Slavery Act [1] 2015 for the financial year 2018. The Group Hyperion Insurance Group Limited (the “Company”/“Hyperion”) is registered in England and Wales under company registration number 2937398. Registered office: One Creechurch Place, London, EC3A 5AF. The Company has a number of subsidiaries including DUAL International Limited, Howden Broking Group Limited, RKH Group Limited, Hyperion X Limited and Hyperion Services Limited (together, the “Group”). Our Approach The Group is committed to ensuring that its business dealings are carried out in compliance with the relevant laws and, in doing so, we endorse the implementation and promotion of ethical business practices to protect workers from being abused and exploited. The Group is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate activities and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.
Organisation structure & supply chain due diligence This statement covers the activities of the Group which is headquartered in London and has 4,700 employees in entities across the world.
Supply chain management Whilst the Group exercises a vital role in the insurance distribution chain, it does not have a supply chain that is reliant on factories or other entities that would normally be associated with slavery or forced labour.
As a general rule, contractors and suppliers used by the Group are therefore not likely to be susceptible to this risk. However, we are mindful that others may not always uphold standards to the same level as the Group. Consequently, employees responsible for managing suppliers and others involved with the Group are, themselves, responsible for ensuring that our values and ideals are upheld. This continues to be a work in progress and we are strengthening our controls as new contracts are agreed. For example, serious violations by suppliers will lead to the termination of the business relationship.
The Group continues to review its supply chain in line with identifiable risks and ensure this information is shared within the Group. The Group is also in the process of creating global procurement principles which will be shared as a recommendation across the Group.
Relevant Policies The Group operates a number of policies that mitigate the risk of modern slavery and set out steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its operations.

Whistleblowing The Group encourages all its workers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of, the organisation. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The Group’s whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Employees, clients and customers or others who have concerns can use our confidential helpline. Recruitment and Selection The Group uses only specified, reputable employment agencies to source labour. All entities in the Group ensure appropriate controls are in place to ensure employees have the right to work and are therefore protected by employment legislation. This includes checking right-to-work documents, visas and passports. The Group does not employ individuals that would be considered to be ‘child workers’. Young and inexperienced workers may be employed or given work experience, but they are subject to the rights and protections that we afford all workers. Basic rights which we expect all workers to enjoy, include:
• The right to a reasonable wage • The right to a safe working environment • The right to an appropriate level of holiday and cover for period of sickness • The freedom to complain directly via our whistleblowing policy free of charge, if they believe that they are not being fairly
treated or have any other concerns. Right of Audit All offices in the Group are subject to periodic audits. Core audit work includes an assessment of the basic working conditions of our staff and consideration of our ability to oversee controls discharged by third party suppliers. Training Key individuals dealing with significant procurement on behalf of the Group attend relevant modern slavery training. Our modern slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 2018, has been sent to the Board for approval, as reflected by the Group CEO’s signature below.

Pursuant to the United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery Act 2015, Chapter 30, Part 6, Provision 54 and to
Section 3 of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, Konica Minolta Business Solutions
Europe GmbH states that it has taken the measures described below to ensure that slavery and human
trafficking is not taking place in any of its supply chains and in any part of its business.
The Konica Minolta Business Solutions Europe GmbH is part of the Konica Minolta-group, a multi-corporate
enterprise of worldwide operating subsidiaries and affiliates with over 40,000 employees under the roof of
Konica Minolta is engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of multi-functional peripherals,
printers, equipment for production printing systems and graphic arts, inkjet printheads and textile printers for
industrial use, related consumables and solution services, equipment for healthcare systems, measuring

electronic materials (including TAC films), lighting source panels, functional films and optical products.
For more details about the corporate structure and business areas of Konica Minolta see here:
II. Corporate Social Responsibility in Konica Minolta's Supply Chain
Konica Minolta is aware, that it is essential to promote Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) not only within
its own operations - based on its central Charter of Corporate Behavior and region-/business-specific Codes
of Conduct derived thereof -, but also across its entire supply chain. Therefore Konica Minolta joined the

Regarding the procurement of goods and services, that are essential for the global portfolio of Konica
Minolta, KMI has set up and conducts a ""CSR Procurement Promotion Program"", which provides several
steps to verify, evaluate and address risks for a CSR-compliant procurement. The first step is to set clear
expectations of the suppliers. These expectations are primary codified in Konica Minolta's Procurement
Policy and in Konica Minolta's Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), which is identical with the Code of Conduct
of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC). The EICC is an organization of more than 100
companies, including the world's leading electronics manufacturers and their major suppliers (Konica Minolta
is a member of the EICC since 2013). In a next step the suppliers of Konica Minolta are requested to
conduct a self-assessment and fill out a questionnaire in order to evaluate, if and to which extent they meet
the Konica Minolta's CSR-Standards. If necessary, Konica Minolta demands and supports the
implementation of appropriate improvements. Additionally Konica Minolta or assigned EICC-certified
organizations perform CSR audits, if this is indicated/advisable in particular cases on basis of the results of
the CSR (self-) assessment and/or a concrete suspicion (risk-based approach).
Regarding goods and services, that are procured by a regional/local operating Konica Minolta entity in order

Conduct (SCoC) and also cover the prohibition of slavery and human trafficking. Point 1 of the SCoC
stipulates: ""Forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery or
trafficking of persons shall not be used. This includes transporting, harboring, recruiting, transferring or
receiving persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction or fraud for labor or services. There shall be

This statement sets out the steps taken by A.G. BARR p.l.c. to ensure that our business and supply
chain are free from slavery and human trafficking.
Summary

approach to modern slavery of any kind within our operations and supply chain. Our workers are
encouraged to report any concerns they may have and management are required to act upon them.
We have taken and will continue to take a number of steps to ensure that slavery and human
trafficking do not take place in any part of our business or supply chain. We are proud of the steps we
have taken to date which include:
implementing a formal supplier approval process across our supply base, which includes
focus upon human rights and labour standards policies;
directly auditing our key primary materials supply base on a periodic basis; and

workers and contractors receive at least the minimum appropriate living wage rate set by the
Living Wage Foundation.

Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We operate an Ethical Trading Policy that reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity
in all our business relationships. Our Ethical Trading Policy is an important part of our framework for
controlling slavery and human trafficking risk. It sets out our standards in relation to our suppliers'
treatment of workers, child labour, legal compliance, discrimination and health & safety. We monitor
and measure supplier compliance with our Ethical Trading Policy through our supplier approval and
audit processes.
Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking
We understand the risk of modern slavery taking place in our supply chain. We take a risk-based
approach to our selection of suppliers and ethical trading is an important part of our risk assessment
processes. In order to identify, monitor and mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking taking
place within our supply chain we take the following steps:
Our contract tender process requires the completion of a formal supplier approval
questionnaire which includes an assessment of our suppliers' human rights and labour
standards status; and
Our supplier audit programme allows us to periodically assess the working conditions at our
key materials suppliers' production sites and to verify that relevant policies are being adhered
to.

This statement is made by Center Parcs (Holdings 1) Limited, company registration number 07656429 (we, us, our or the Company) pursuant to section 54, Part 5 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (Act). It constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 21 April 2016 and sets out the steps taken that aim to ensure that slavery or human trafficking did not take place in our business and supply chain.
The Company is the UK parent company for the Center Parcs operating businesses. The group has approximately 7,500 employees and is based in the UK.
OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
Center Parcs is a leading UK short-break holiday business. We operate five specially constructed holiday villages in the United Kingdom. Our supply chains include the procurement of goods and services necessary for the operation of holiday villages and for re-sale to our guests. We are committed to eradicating modern slavery and human trafficking in any part of our business and supply chain. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. Our Ethical Trading Policy is part of our commitment to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls that aim to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chain. We try to ensure that we work with UK and international suppliers who treat their obligations towards modern slavery and human trafficking with the same importance that we do.
During the year we started to put in place systems and procedures to:  Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chain – using a risk based approach we
looked at supplier spend, location and type of product or service.
 Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chain - by requiring key suppliers to complete a modern slavery questionnaire and to sign our Ethical Trading Policy. The Ethical Trading Policy requires our suppliers to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking does not occur within their supply chain.
 Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chain – by collating and assessing the modern slavery questionnaires and taking remedial action where necessary and including modern slavery and human trafficking questions within all relationship review meetings.
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain and our business, we will be providing training, initially to our procurement teams and

plan to roll out the training to other key employees responsible for the procurement of goods and services.
Our employees are encouraged to identify and report any potential breaches of our policies through our independent whistleblowing hotline.
We also plan to review our general terms and conditions and key contracts to include specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children.
Based on the above, we consider that our policies and procedures are transitioning towards a reasonable level of assurance of effectiveness in eradicating modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chain.

Labour exploitation is exploitation of job applicants and workers by third party individuals or gangs other than the employer or labour provider including rogue individuals working within these businesses but without the knowledge of management. It includes forced labour and human trafficking for labour exploitation, payment for work-finding services and work-related exploitation such as forced use of accommodation. It is understood that it is often well hidden by the perpetrators with victims reluctant to come forward.
The hotel also recognises the responsibility that it shares with its suppliers to tackle forced labour.

Directors’ introduction:
“Gap Inc. is committed to supporting and improving labor rights and working conditions globally across the retail and apparel industries. As a business we owe a moral responsibility to protect and care for all those whose work goes into creating our products and bringing them to our customers. Likewise, our customers have a right to wear Gap Inc. clothes and use our products with the knowledge that we are living up to their own high ethical standards.
Our commitment in this regard applies equally to all of our brands: Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, Intermix, and Weddington Way. Styles, materials and prices may vary across the range of products we create and sell to our customers, but our core values do not change. Wherever we operate, and whoever we are operating with, we strive to do so in compliance with our overall Human Rights Policy.
This statement is made in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, as well as the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. It is also made in accordance with the expectations that any reasonable consumer would place on a global retailer such as Gap Inc.
For more information on our commitment to ethical and sustainable sourcing of products please visit Gap’s Global Sustainability Webpage.“
This statement has been approved by the boards of directors of Gap Inc., GPS (Great Britain) Limited, Gap (UK Holdings) Ltd and Gap Europe Limited and signed on behalf of those companies by Art Peck, CEO of Gap Inc. This confirms that the boards of the UK companies and Gap Inc. have considered and approved the statement for fiscal year 2016.
____________________________ Art Peck CEO, Gap, Inc.

Introduction to our Business
Gap Inc. is a leading global apparel retail company, founded in California, USA in 1969, offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, Intermix, and Weddington Way brands. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by Gap Inc. and manufactured by contracted vendors. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, especially at our Intermix brand.
We purchase private label and non-private label merchandise from approximately 900 facilities in approximately 40 countries. The factories that manufacture our branded apparel collectively employ over 1 million people worldwide, and we have a rigorous risk assessment framework, as well as locally implemented worker-related programs, to ensure any forced labor and human trafficking risks are minimized within our supply chain. Under no circumstance is it acceptable for child, forced, or trafficked labor to be employed within our operations or used in the production of any Gap Inc. product.
We believe that no person should be subject to a situation where basic needs and fundamental rights are denied, which is why we have regularly partnered with governments, NGOs, consultants and trade unions to forge innovative solutions to systemic issues in the garment and textile supply chain.
Policies
Our efforts to address human trafficking in the apparel industry are guided by our Human Rights Policy, which is founded on the principles outlined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”) and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (often referred to as the “ILO Core Conventions”). Our policy applies to both our wholly owned operations and our branded apparel supply chain. This policy establishes key principles that guide how we run our business, as well as the core issues that we work to address.
Gap Inc. has a Code of Vendor Conduct (COVC) that applies to all facilities that produce branded goods for Gap Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates or agents, which states that the company prohibits the use of “involuntary labor of any kind, including prison labor, debt bondage, slave labor or forced labor by governments.""
Our Code of Business Conduct (COBC) requires our employees to act ethically and with integrity at all times. It also includes provisions on salient human rights issues. All employees are required to complete the Principles of Integrity: Code of Business Conduct Overview training course to ensure their understanding of our commitments.
Our Retail Business
With a global workforce of approximately 140,000 employees, Gap Inc. has nearly 3,200 Companyoperated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mexico. Franchise agreements also exist with unaffiliated franchisees to operate

Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through third-party websites.
Wherever we employ people directly, we do so in accordance with our Human Rights Policy and in compliance with all local labor laws. Members of the store management team visit our retail stores on a regular basis to ensure that our policies are put into practice, and our loss prevention and audit teams carry out annual assessments of our stores. Similar internal audit processes are carried out in respect to practices within our Distribution Centers. We also have a hotline available for all employees to report any breaches of policies, as well as an anti-retaliation policy that protects them when doing so. Our employees are bound to comply with our COBC and a breach of the ethical principles contained therein could lead to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
Due diligence is also carried out on a periodic basis in respect to our franchise partners. Such due diligence encompasses a variety of issues including research into franchisee supply chains and working conditions. For non-merchandise vendors, we typically reserve full rights of assessment in our contracts and exercise such rights when appropriate so as to verify vendor compliance with all applicable laws and contractual terms.
Supply Chain Due Diligence and Verification
Prior to accepting any order for Gap Inc. branded product, our suppliers are required to sign our Vendor Compliance Agreement (VCA). Gap Inc. also has a vendor approval process that requires new suppliers to undergo an assessment against our COVC, as well as technical capability evaluation prior to beginning production for Gap Inc. After the initial assessment of working conditions, the facility either earns approval or is placed in pending status while it addresses outstanding issues. The COVC that is used for the assessments contains provisions related to forced labor, child labor, foreign contract workers, and identity document retention.
In signing Gap Inc.’s VCA, which incorporates our COVC, Gap Inc. suppliers agree to comply with the following:
“All applicable laws, rules and regulations … these laws include, but are not limited to, laws relating to the employment conditions of their respective employees such as: (1) wage and hour, labor, child labor, and forced labor requirements; (2) health and safety; (3) immigration; (4) discrimination; (5) labor or workers’ rights in general; and (6) environmental laws and regulations.”
Gap Inc.’s Supplier Sustainability team is responsible for the implementation of our supply chain policies and standards relevant to human trafficking and forced labor. These policies and standards are reflected within the COVC. Assessment & Remediation Specialists – who are locally hired in the countries from which we source, and speak local languages – assess and validate that suppliers are meeting the expectations outlined in our COVC. We have additional requirements designed to protect foreign contract workers employed by vendors. We monitor how foreign contract labor is used at factories

producing Gap Inc. branded apparel to help ensure that people are free to work as they choose. Our Foreign Contract Worker (FCW) Requirements specify that workers will not be charged fees, a policy we have had in place for over a decade, and that any fees and costs payable to host governments for the documentation of foreign contract workers will be covered by the facility.
On the ground, our Assessment & Remediation Specialists have a deep knowledge of these issues from interviewing workers, gaining their trust, and learning over time which agents and factories have good reputations and practices and those requiring improvement.
Gap Inc. monitors all first tier branded apparel supplier facilities (including sub-contractors and supporting units) for forced labor and human trafficking, and is in the process of establishing social criteria which will enable us to evaluate working conditions at the mill level.
Our COVC further states that factories must allow “Gap Inc. and/or any of its representatives or agents unrestricted access to its facilities and to all relevant records at all times, whether or not notice is provided in advance.” Gap Inc. conducts both announced and unannounced audits in the factories we monitor, that are primarily conducted by Gap Inc. staff. Initial inspections for new factories are generally coordinated with the requested vendor or factory, and with subsequent full evaluations we aim for more than 50% to be unannounced or semi-announced.
A number of factories producing our branded apparel participate in the Better Work program, a collaborative factory monitoring initiative led by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Factories participating in Better Work are assessed by specialists employed by the ILO. These assessments are 100% unannounced.
Gap Inc.’s Supplier Sustainability team is trained to recognize situations where a facility may be using forced or involuntary labor, and is also trained to assess compliance with our company’s Foreign Contract Worker requirements. We publicly report aggregate findings of assessment results at the factories that make our branded apparel on our company website.
Accountability
Three members of Gap Inc.’s Board of Directors sit on the Governance and Sustainability Committee, of which Robert J. Fisher, our founders’ son, is chairman. The Global Sustainability department collaborates with key departments across the company including Supply Chain, Corporate Affairs, Human Resources, Legal and Gap Foundation.
Failure of vendors to abide by Gap Inc.’s COVC and/or VCA can result in corrective action up to and including the termination of all existing and future business.
Training
Gap Inc. continually strives to become more effective at identifying and correcting issues in our supply chain, which can be hard to detect, even for a well-trained and experienced eye. Gap Inc.’s Supplier Sustainability team works directly with factory management and workers in the factories we monitor.

Our COVC also has stringent requirements around Foreign Contract Workers, who are at risk of exploitation by indentured servitude. For over a decade, we have had a “no fees” policy that applies to Foreign Contract Workers, and also have requirements that cover the entire employment cycle of Foreign Contract Workers. Our requirements span recruitment, employment, up to termination of employment, and provide the lens through which our assessors look at policies, practices, and conditions in the factory to find indications of or risks to forced labor.
In addition to ongoing training, our Assessment & Remediation team convenes regularly to discuss program effectiveness and improvements. In April 2015, based on a thorough risk assessment, we strengthened our Foreign Contract Worker requirements and updated them by providing additional detailed guidance on recruitment, fees, employment contracts, and onsite policies and practices, including equal treatment and non-discrimination. Additionally, we added a requirement for our vendors to conduct due diligence and regular assessments of employment agencies.
To supplement our own staff, Gap Inc. works to build the capabilities of our suppliers by conducting worker trainings, participating in multi-stakeholder initiatives, and forging partnerships with expert stakeholders and suppliers to address specific human rights issues. Gap Inc. has helped suppliers improve their capabilities for more than a decade, and created field teams for social & labor capability building that are dedicated to helping suppliers manage and improve the sustainability of their own operations.
Evaluating Risks
Gap Inc. works with governments and NGOs, and monitors resources – such as the U.S. Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Annual Report and the Global Slavery Index to identify high risk areas in our supply chain. We adopt a comprehensive view of the industry and areas of risk and focus our efforts where we do business and where our programs can have the greatest impact.
While subcontracting is a common practice in the apparel industry, engaged in by suppliers to manage production capacity and fulfill large orders, it can pose a risk. Unauthorized Subcontracting (UAS) is problematic because suppliers may outsource production to facilities that we have not approved and that do not uphold our requirements for safe, fair labor practices and working conditions. Smaller, unauthorized units may have labor practices that put workers at risk, and are beyond the view of our assessment and remediation team. Expanding the collaboration between our sustainability and sourcing teams can help us address UAS issues since incidents can be difficult to detect through the periodic factory assessments conducted by our sustainability field team. We take extra precautionary measures in countries with high risk of UAS, such as specialized training for suppliers and factory management.
Risk mapping has identified, in addition to UAS and foreign contract workers, the particular risks that refugee workers may face. For example, we know that certain countries from which we source are absorbing Syrian refugees into their formal economies. We are committed to partnering with a broad set of stakeholders to ensure that our vendors have the appropriate capabilities and infrastructure in place to ensure that opportunities for employment and fair, decent working conditions are made

available to them. In Jordan, we are partnering with The World Bank on a project emphasizing job readiness training and employment placement for Syrian refugees. Similarly, in Turkey, we are partnering with the Ethical Trade Initiative and other brands to address the challenges associated with the integration of refugee and migrant workers from Syria, in an effort to ensure that they are not forced into precarious work given their vulnerability in the country.
Beyond our Tier 1 facilities, we have also engaged stakeholders to address the risk of forced labor deeper in the supply chain. For example, Gap Inc. has played a significant role in collaborative efforts to identify and implement lasting solutions to address employment practices and working conditions, including forced labor, in the garment industry in Tamil Nadu, India. Gap Inc. initiated a meeting for Brands Ethical Working Group (BEWG) members and the Tirupur Exporters Association (TEA) that resulted in the formation of the Tirupur Stakeholders Forum (TSF). The TSF has since agreed upon a set of guidelines for factories to use to help eliminate unacceptable employment practices.
Gap Inc. also helped to develop the ETI Tamil Nadu Multi-Stakeholder Program (TNMS) with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), alongside 15 other major Brands and Retailers, key local and international NGOs and trade unions, including Anti-Slavery International and IndustriALL, to address the Sumangali scheme and other exploitative labor practices in southern India, particularly forced labor. These efforts were undertaken even though there is no established link between Gap and the facilities where these practices were found. For more information: http://www.gapincsustainability.com/forced-labor-0
In Myanmar, we have actively supported opportunities for private sector collaboration and have played a leadership role in Business for Social Responsibility’s (BSR) Myanmar Responsible Sourcing Working Group (MRSWG). The MRSWG focuses on key challenges in the Myanmar garment sector, especially child and forced labor which remains a significant concern in the country. As a founding member of the MRSWG, we also helped to develop BSR’s Principles of Responsible Sourcing for Myanmar’s Garment Sector. The Principles were informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO conventions and consultations with more than 20 local stakeholders.
Additionally, considering the evidence on forced labor in Uzbekistan’s cotton industry, we have signed the Cotton Pledge led by the Responsible Sourcing Network and have worked to educate and influence our suppliers and factories on this issue, making it clear that we will not accept any clothing manufactured with fabrics that were knowingly made from Uzbek cotton.
To further address the risk of forced labor in our supply chain, Gap Inc. engaged Verité in 2015 to review our policy for ensuring that foreign contract workers working in facilities producing for Gap Inc. are not being exploited or discriminated against.
Assessment of Effectiveness
More than 20 years since we began our journey to improve working conditions, we are still learning – and facing new challenges. After we documented more red-rated factories in the 2013-2014 time period

than in 2011-2012 (red is our lowest rating and signals that immediate action is required at a factory to address one or more serious issues) we investigated further and took steps to reverse this trend. By 2016, we decreased our share of red rated factories from 18.47% to 16%. In that time frame, we succeeded in resolving 88% of critical issues and 84% of non-critical issues at all low-performing factories in this category. We have set a goal to have all of our strategic suppliers be rated yellow or green by 2020. To help reach that goal, our work with Verité, via our Workforce Engagement Program, allows us to assess factory performance based on the data we receive directly from workers through surveys and interviews. To date, we have conducted approximately 100 Workforce Engagement assessments in partnership with Verité, covering facilities in Bangladesh, China, Guatemala, India, and Vietnam.

For more information, please visit https://corporate.discovery.com/ and follow @DiscoveryIncTV across social platforms.
We are transforming our business following the acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive in March 2018, but our ethical, social and environmental standards remain a core part of our culture and integral to our relationship with our suppliers. We are taking the opportunity presented by the integration of two world-class media companies to re-examine how we help protect vulnerable groups. We are supported in this effort by the Ethics & Compliance team, which is part of the Legal department.
As of December 31, 2017, the legacy Discovery entities employed approximately 7,000 people globally, of whom more than 1,000 were based in the UK, and the legacy Scripps entities employed approximately 3,600 people globally, of whom approximately 150 were based in the UK. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, the legacy companies worked with an aggregate of close to 30,000 suppliers worldwide.
Policies
Discovery’s Code of Ethics defines our commitment to operate with integrity in all our business activities. It applies to all Discovery employees, officers and directors, to all our divisions and subsidiaries around the globe and to those joint ventures that are subject to the Code. We strive to do business with people who share our values and expect our contractors and business partners to comply with similar ethical and legal standards. There are additional global as well as local policies underpinning the Code, including our Ethics Hotline and Policy on Handling Allegations of NonCompliance. These policies explain where to go for further help and advice, including how to raise concerns.
We recognise and respect all labour and employment laws, including those respecting freedom of association, privacy and equal employment opportunity, wherever we operate. We believe that working positively and directly with employees best serves their interests. As far as we are aware, we do not use forced or involuntary labour in our supply chains. We seek to comply with all applicable child labour laws.
Discovery has a Global Source-to-Pay Policy that covers the process for contracting and paying suppliers. This states that the Code of Ethics is enforced and that Discovery employees who transact business with suppliers must be kept informed about sources of supply, methods, services and materials and seek out, develop and utilize new and existing suppliers who share Discovery’s values.
Supplier Due Diligence
In 2017, there was no change to the methodology devised by Procurement, Internal Audit and Compliance Legal to identify and engage with suppliers who carry higher risks of poor recruitment and labour practices, especially in the

developing world.
Specifically, Discovery continued to use its Modern Slavery Pack comprising: (i) a letter in which we set out our commitment to ensuring transparency in our own business and tackling modern slavery through our supply chains; (ii) a Modern Slavery Act supplier self-assessment due diligence questionnaire regarding the use of forced labour and steps taken to ensure it is not used in our suppliers’ supply chains; and (iii) a supplier Code of Conduct. This sets out our zerotolerance approach to forced labour and our expectations of suppliers to ensure there is no forced labour in their own supply chains. Those of our suppliers deemed to be of high inherent risk were sent this Modern Slavery Pack and required to warrant that they would comply with our supplier Code of Conduct.
The methodology also imposed on Procurement and Legal the obligation to carry out due diligence at the pre-qualification stage on suppliers deemed to be of high inherent risk. This includes questions on a range of issues, including bribery and corruption, data protection, environmental sustainability as well as slavery and human trafficking. We also request such suppliers to provide us with information about the due diligence mechanisms they have in place with their own suppliers further down the supply chain.
Our agreements with new suppliers contain an explicit prohibition on forced and child labour, obligations to agree with our policies and rights of inspection and audit. We also updated and amended existing agreements to include modern slavery provisions.
We are committed to collaborating with suppliers and other stakeholders to raise working standards. Where possible, we choose to work with our suppliers to resolve any potential issues rather than terminating the supplier contract and leaving the issue unresolved.
Risk Assessment
Discovery’s Ethics & Compliance team continues to conduct ongoing review of our modern slavery risk. Our focus areas remain:
Our People
Discovery employs people both directly and through several business partners. We recognise that where workers are employed through business partners or recruitment agencies, we are not directly responsible for the employee relationship or how they manage their employees. To mitigate this risk, we require certain contractual standards, which are supported by the way we work.
Production
Discovery’s content supply chains are diverse and include commissioned content from production companies and finished content licensed from distribution and production companies.
Facilities Services
Services such as catering, security and cleaning are often subcontracted and can be filled by a high proportion of migrant workers, making them potentially higher risk in relation to slavery and human trafficking.
Products
Discovery Global Enterprises licences its trademarks to licensees who manufacture and distribute branded products such as apparel, stationery, toys and other merchandise.
Governance
Discovery has formal governance processes and committees in place for overseeing our commitment to ethical conduct.
Discovery is a mission-driven company that engages in a number of corporate social responsibility activities each year, including a day of volunteering called Impact Day.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the Discovery group’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2017.

Slavery and human trafficking statement
Introduction
This statement is issued by Ashmore Group plc (“Ashmore”), a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, in compliance with section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
References herein to “Ashmore” are to Ashmore Group plc and/or its UK wholly owned subsidiaries, Ashmore Investment Management Limited and Ashmore Investment Advisors Limited (which are
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority), as applicable.
Our business
Ashmore is listed on the London Stock Exchange, is a constituent of the FTSE 250 index and is a leading emerging markets fund manager with over 20 years’ experience of investment expertise through active management across its core investment themes: external debt, local currency, corporate debt, blended debt, equities, multi-asset and alternatives in addition to currency overlay/liquidity with the largest themes being in Fixed Income (Sovereign and Corporate Debt).
As an organisation whose sole business is the provision of asset management services, Ashmore considers the risk of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour (together, “Modern Slavery”) and human trafficking existing within its business to be low.
Structure and supply chains
Ashmore expects its suppliers to adopt the same standards it meets itself, and in turn work only with companies that share these values and principles. Ashmore’s suppliers are expected to uphold their workers’ human rights and treat them respectfully, while maintaining workplaces emphasising ethical and fair behaviour.
Due diligence
Ashmore does not support or knowingly deal with any business involved in slavery or human trafficking and will not work with any party it suspects is connected with slavery in any way.
Ashmore conducted a due diligence process in 2019, covering the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Ashmore assesses the likelihood of the existence of Modern Slavery within its supply chain on the basis of perceived risk. In implementing this approach, the criteria taken into account include factors such as the origin of manufacture and the nature of services provided. Ashmore also assesses the location from which the services are provided which enables Ashmore to categorise suppliers and identify potential areas to assess for Modern Slavery.
Action taken
Ashmore has undertaken a review of its existing suppliers and evaluated the risk of any supplier being unable to meet its obligations under the Act. In response to this review a Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code”) was developed and published on the Ashmore website. This Code applies to all suppliers that have business relations with Ashmore, and outlines the minimum ethical requirements that suppliers must meet in order to

do business with the Group. These include freedom of employment, and the prevention of any form of forced, bonded or involuntary labour (including child labour).
Ashmore is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact and supports the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour.Ashmore has a zero-tolerance approach to Modern Slavery in its organisation and supply chain.
Ashmore’s own standard template terms and conditions for suppliers include clauses that forbid the use of slavery and human trafficking.
Training for staff
Ashmore does not operate a centralised procurement team and therefore undertakes internal training to enable staff to have an understanding of the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act and flag potential issues.
Our Continuing commitment
Ashmore will continue to take these steps and in the event that Ashmore becomes aware of Modern Slavery occurring within its supply chain, will seek to ensure that the supplier implements remedial action. Ashmore expects its suppliers to react to any Modern Slavery issues constructively and responsibly, and in a manner demonstrating their willingness to remedy issues expediently. Ashmore further reserves the right to refuse to partner with suppliers that do not achieve or are unable to demonstrate the eradication of Modern Slavery within their organisations and supply chains.
Board Approval
The Board of Ashmore Group plc approved this statement on 6 December 2019 as the Ashmore slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 30 June 2019. A copy of this statement has been signed by a Director of the Company.

248,"SL AVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT FOR JAGUAR L AND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (JLR) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016
JLR’s Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 “Transparency in Supply Chains”. This Statement sets out the steps JLR has taken to address the risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place within its own operations and supply chains. For the purposes of this Statement JLR’s joint venture arrangements are treated as being part of our supply chains.
OUR ORG ANISATION

Business Sector
JLR’s primary business is the manufacture of premium automobiles. JLR has two globally-recognised brands: Land Rover, a manufacturer of premium all-terrain vehicles and Jaguar, a manufacturer of sports cars and saloons. JLR also supplies automotive parts and services, branded merchandise and a range of driving experiences.
Organisational Structure
During the year ended 31 March 2016, the average number of staff working for JLR was approximately:

Average Staff Numbers (’000) Direct Employees (Salaried) Direct Employees (Hourly Paid) Agency Staff Total

UK 11.4 16.3 7.0 34.7

Overseas 2.1 0.2 2.3

Total 13.5 16.3 7.2 37.0

JLR has a global sales network across 160 countries and approximately 1,700 franchised dealer sites worldwide. We service 20 international markets with JLR owned National Sales Companies (NSCs). Other markets are serviced through export and import partners.
United Kingdom Global Headquarters, Research, Design, Engineering and Manufacturing.

Key Current manufacturing plants
Future manufacturing plants National Sales Company / Regional Office Research centre

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Manufacturing site, in the final stages of pre-production.

JLR’s traditional manufacturing base is in the UK. As at 31 March 2016 a new JLR wholly-owned factory in Brazil was in the final stages of pre-production. Chery Jaguar Land Rover, the Company’s joint venture in China with Chery Automobile Company Ltd, has been treated as part of JLR’s supply chain for the purposes of this statement.

Responding to the Modern Slavery Act

JLR has mobilised a cross-functional working group, under the sponsorship of the Executive Director of Human Resources and Global Purchasing, to assess and respond to the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, with representation from Group Compliance, Purchasing, Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility. We have an ongoing programme to improve our response to slavery and human trafficking risk. Existing policies and practices have been reviewed and updated. The JLR Audit Committee has been kept regularly informed of progress with this programme.
- 1 -

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING RISKS WITHIN JLR’S OPERATIONS
POLICIES IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING In light of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, we have reviewed the content of our Code of Conduct and Corporate Policies and updated our Policies to be more explicit about slavery and human trafficking.
Code of Conduct
The JLR Code of Conduct (the Code) is applicable to all personnel working for and on behalf of JLR globally (JLR Personnel), including direct employees and agency and contract staff. The Code states that: “We expect human rights to be respected and we will not tolerate the use of child labour or forced labour in our worldwide operations or by our business partners.”
All JLR direct employees are required to sign up to the Code on joining the business. The Code is available to JLR Personnel on the JLR intranet and to external parties via the JLR Corporate website.
The JLR Annual Compliance Declaration process requires all JLR salaried staff globally and selected other staff to confirm that they are aware of the Code and acknowledge that they are bound by it. For the December 2015 declaration process, 99.97% of this population of approximately 16,000 people have completed their declaration.
Human Rights Policy
JLR’s new Human Rights Policy was approved in March 2016. It articulates in a single policy pre-existing JLR requirements with regards to the protection of human rights. The Policy applies to all JLR Personnel and has been distributed company-wide. It sets out our commitment to respecting human rights and complying with laws, rules and regulations governing human rights in the territories in which we operate. This includes specific provisions addressing slavery, human trafficking, forced labour, child labour and upholding each employee’s right to freedom of association.
Recruitment Practices
JLR undertakes “right to work” checks on all direct employees prior to them commencing their roles with the Company. This includes checking, where applicable, that the employee has a valid work visa and is of an appropriate age to work.
Trade Unions and Other Bodies Representing Workers
Through the Code, Human Rights Policy and employment practices, JLR recognises and respects each employee’s right to freedom of association, including the right to join trade unions.
Access to Remedy for Victims
If JLR Personnel identify any potential signs of slavery, human trafficking or other human rights abuses, they are encouraged to report this to JLR management directly or through our externally run “Speak Up” confidential reporting facility. The guidance in our Confidential Reporting Policy has been updated to be more explicit about reporting concerns regarding slavery and human trafficking.
To date, JLR has received no reports of concerns regarding slavery or human trafficking in our operations. In the event that such issues were reported to us, we would undertake an urgent thorough investigation into the concerns raised under the supervision of Executive Committee members. If the investigation confirmed the concerns, we would put in place robust action plans to address the issue and protect the victims.
TRAINING ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
A modern slavery briefing sheet has been provided to all JLR Personnel.
Training has been delivered to those individuals in roles most likely to be in a position to identify and address potential modern slavery risks, including our Human Resources and Purchasing functions. At the date of this report, 99% of the target population have completed this training.
RISKS OF SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN JLR’S OWN OPERATIONS
We have undertaken an assessment of slavery and human trafficking risks within JLR’s own operations. We considered: the location of our operations; roles being performed; recruitment processes; and absence to date of reports of concerns regarding slavery and human trafficking.
As well as direct employees, JLR has agency and contract staff working at our sites. Contractual terms and conditions are in place with the companies that provide JLR with agency staff, requiring them to have a process in place to protect human rights.
Based on our risk assessments, we deem the risk of slavery or human trafficking occurring within JLR’s direct employee population, or our agency and contract staff population under our direct supervision, to be low.
- 2 -

S L AV ERY A N D H UMA N TRA FFI C K I N G RISKS WITHIN JLR’S SUPPLY CHAINS
JLR sources goods and services directly from a global network of approximately 10,300 active suppliers, based in 62 countries. These suppliers can be analysed by the area of the JLR business that they primarily supply goods and services to, as follows:

Area of JLR Business Production and Special Vehicle Operations Non-production and NSCs After-market Merchandising Total

Approximate Number of Suppliers 500 8,500 1,200 100
10,300

Like other automobile manufacturers, JLR’s supply chain is highly complex. This complexity and limitations on the visibility beyond the first tier of the supply chain mean there are inherent challenges in efficiently and effectively assessing and addressing supply chain issues, such as human rights risks. Therefore, our work to address slavery and human trafficking risks within our supply chains has been focussed primarily on our Tier 1 suppliers this year.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS
JLR actively manages its relationships with its Tier 1 suppliers. There are clear contractual arrangements in place with all direct suppliers, who are required to sign up to JLR’s Global Terms & Conditions (Global T&Cs).
JLR communicates the standards expected of its suppliers through a variety of mechanisms including: supplier conferences; Achilles (a supply chain management platform); Covisint (a global supplier portal); direct buyer interactions; emails to suppliers; and via the JLR Corporate website.
The importance of addressing the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains was reiterated to key JLR suppliers at our supplier conference in May 2016.
EXPECTATIONS OF SUPPLIERS
The standards JLR expect its suppliers to meet, including standards equivalent to those articulated in the Code, are set out in the Global T&Cs, which also detail human rights requirements, including basic working conditions.
The Global T&Cs are supported by the JLR Sustainability Guide – Supplier Environmental & Social Requirements (The Sustainability Guide), which articulates the minimum environmental and social standards JLR expects all its suppliers and business partners to adhere to. It addresses working conditions (including specific reference to the Modern Slavery Act), with expectations of processes and safeguards to demonstrate compliance. There is an accompanying Minimum Standard of Working Conditions Self-Assessment Checklist.
There are a number of processes in operation that address human rights risks within JLR’s supply chains. These include:
-- The Achilles Automotive Community platform, which is used to engage with production and construction suppliers. To date, 237 production suppliers have completed self-assessment questionnaires which include questions regarding forced / bonded and child labour. No slavery or human trafficking issues have been reported to us through these questionnaires. Next year the Achilles questionnaire will be updated to more specifically address the Modern Slavery Act.
-- The new Supplier Technical Assistance diagnostic tool (implemented in March 2016), which assesses all potential new suppliers for Production and Special Vehicle Operations. It includes six questions on human rights. Suppliers are asked to confirm that they do not employ any form of forced, prison or child labour. No slavery or human trafficking issues have yet been identified by this new process.
-- Manufacturing Site Self-Assessment (MSSA), which is a pre-qualification process for new suppliers of branded merchandise. The MSSA asks for information on labour standards, whistleblowing facilities and ethical / social audits completed. Responses have been received from approximately 70% of current merchandising suppliers. No slavery or human trafficking issues have been reported to us through these self-assessments.
-- JLR China Supplier Self-Assessments, which new suppliers to JLR China are asked to complete, addressing legal and regulatory obligations, including labour laws. We also undertake searches of publicly available sources to see whether concerns are highlighted. No slavery or human trafficking issues have been identified through these assessments.

If we became aware of slavery or human trafficking concerns within our supply chains, we would seek to work with the relevant suppliers to improve conditions for their workforce. We reserve the right to deselect suppliers if they were to fail to make the required improvements within a reasonable timeframe. To date, JLR is not aware of any reports of slavery or human trafficking within our supply chains.

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF SL AVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN JLR’S SUPPLY CHAINS We have undertaken an exercise to assess slavery and human trafficking risk within JLR’s supply chains. We have evaluated our Tier 1 suppliers by considering the countries where our suppliers are based, products and services being supplied and the volume of spend. The data was evaluated against recognised external sources on perceived slavery risk within sectors and geographic areas, to assess whether suppliers potentially represent higher slavery risk. In this first year of undertaking analysis of slavery risk in our supply chains, the geographical information on suppliers was restricted to the country in which the purchase order was raised, which we have used as a proxy for the country of operation of the supplier. From our risk assessment work to date, considering the type of commodity or service being provided and the country in which the suppliers are based, we have identified 72 suppliers that may potentially represent an elevated risk of slavery or human trafficking. These suppliers span 12 countries: Brazil; China; Egypt; India; Morocco; Poland; Russia; Taiwan; Thailand; Turkey; United Arab Emirates; and Vietnam. We are currently seeking further information to understand how these suppliers protect human rights within their operations. There are also a number of people working on our sites as employees of companies providing outsourced services, such as cleaning and catering. The nature of these services may mean there is an increased inherent risk of slavery and human trafficking. The companies that provide these services are subject to the Global T&Cs. We intend to seek additional assurances from these companies that they have effective procedures to protect their staff from slavery and human trafficking risks. EVOLVING APPROACH TO SL AVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING RISK IN SUPPLY CHAINS The Code, our Policies and contractual terms are clear on the need to protect human rights. However, we recognise that these measures only give a limited degree of comfort that slavery and human trafficking are not occurring within our supply chains. We are working to determine how we can obtain further comfort over the effectiveness of anti-slavery and human trafficking measures beyond the first tier of our supply chain. As our programme progresses, we will prioritise potentially higher risk suppliers for the mitigation measures we implement. These may include: seeking to obtain more reliable and granular data from suppliers; more detailed review of existing supplier information; supplier self-assessment questionnaires or declarations; and audits for selected suppliers. Under the Global T&Cs, JLR has the right to conduct audits of suppliers and / or ask suppliers to submit to third-party assessment. We are not currently exercising this right for the purposes of social audits. One of the next steps within our programme will be to assess whether to commission targeted social auditing of selected suppliers deemed to present a higher slavery risk.

The organisation recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human tra cking. We are absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human tra cking in our corporate activities, and to ensuring that our supply chains are free from slavery and human tra cking.
Organisation Specialist Leisure Group (comprising of Shearings Hotels ltd, National Holidays ltd, and Shearings ltd) is a British hotel and leisure travel company specialising in escorted tours, short breaks, events and river cruises throughout the UK, Europe and worldwide. The Group has a diverse portfolio of owned and managed UK hotels and a collection of sector leading travel brands that offer holidays by coach, rail, river and air.
Our business depends on a reliable network of suppliers for services and products such as venues, hotels, transport, food and retail, in the UK and internationally. To minimise the risk of slavery and human tra cking we:
Contract large chains of hoteliers or accommodation services who are sourced via destination management companies, agents and inbound tour operators based in these destinations. Send risk assessment questionnaires to 3rd party operators reviewing health and safety. These have been adapted to include questions of slavery and human tra cking. Source services and parts overseas through reputable dealers. Undertake an interview and assessment process where practicable before contracts are entered into. Enter into food contracts through key suppliers; including requests to see their policies and statements regarding modern slavery and human tra cking.
Due diligence We undertake due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers, and regularly review our existing suppliers. We are committed to ensuring that our suppliers adhere to the highest standards of ethics. Suppliers are required to demonstrate that they provide safe working conditions where necessary, treat workers with dignity and respect, and act ethically and within the law in their use of labour.
Our policies The Whistleblowing Policy encourages all its workers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of, the organisation. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human tra cking. The organisation's whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.
Our Employee Code of Conduct makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour expected of them when representing the organisation. We strive to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when operating abroad and managing its supply chain.
We use only speci ed, reputable employment agencies to source labour and always verify the practices of any new agency we are using before accepting workers from that agency. All agencies are vetted by the Group’s HR department.
Serious violations of the organisation's Supplier Code of Conduct will lead to the termination of the business relationship.
Training and performance indicators The organisation has reviewed its key performance indicators (KPIs) in light of the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. As a result we require those involved in the supply chain to complete training to ensure understanding of the basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the risks of modern slavery and human tra cking in our business. We are also evaluating all existing suppliers.
This statement has been approved by the organisation's executive committee and is for the year to 31 December 2019, pursuant to section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

About Shell
Royal Dutch Shell plci directly or indirectly holds investments in companies that explore for oil and gas worldwide; develop new oil and gas supplies and have a global network of refineries, chemical plants, and retail sites. Shell companies also transport and trade oil, gas and energy-related products, as well as investing in alternative energy and biofuels production.
Our values and own operations
All Shell companies and Shell operated joint ventures must comply with local legislation and regulations, and must conduct their activities in line with the Shell General Business Principles and our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. We also encourage joint ventures we do not operate to apply materially equivalent business principles.
Respect for human rights is embedded in the Shell General Business Principles and in our Code of Conduct. Our approach is informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
On an annual basis, we collect performance data against internal mandatory requirements such as the Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. Senior Shell representatives are required to confirm such performance data where Shell is the operator or has a controlling interest.
We have a Global Helpline in place for all employees and contract staff in Shell and for third parties with whom Shell has a business relationship (such as customers, suppliers, agents) to raise concerns and report instances of potential non-compliance with our values and principles, in full confidence and without fear of retaliation. Respect for human rights and provision of remedy for potential non-compliance are ways in which we uphold the Shell General Business Principles.
Our supply chain
Each of our suppliers has its own supply chain and we recognise that each level in the supply chain is responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and for respecting human rights. Our focus, for the purpose of this declaration, is on our own direct suppliers, however, we encourage suppliers to share the expectations, as embodied in the Shell Supplier Principles, throughout their own supply chains.
In accordance with the Shell General Business Principles and Code of Conduct, Shell companies seek to work with contractors and suppliers who contribute to sustainable development and are economically, environmentally and socially responsible. Shell companies expect contractors and suppliers to obey the national laws and international standards that require them to treat workers fairly, to provide a safe and healthy work environment and to protect environmental quality. Shell companies will develop and strengthen relationships with contractors and suppliers who are committed to following the Shell Supplier Principles. In 2017, we ran a series of engagements with Shell procurement teams in higher risk locations to raise awareness and improve understanding of contractor worker welfare. For certain contracted services in higher risk locations, we also developed an additional contractual obligation requiring contractors to develop a worker welfare plan that includes, among others, ethical recruitment practices and no use of forced labour.
In conjunction with the Shell Supplier Principles, Shell companies have access to a Supplier Qualification System (SQS) and associated personnel training to gain visibility of up-to-date, accurate supplier information. Suppliers accept registration in SQS and, as a part of registration, suppliers are required to certify that they follow the Shell
1

Supplier Principles or similar standards and their company complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they do business. Under the standard procurement terms generally used by Shell, contractors and suppliers agree to adhere to the Shell General Business Principles and the Shell Supplier Principles. Certain areas of our supply chain may pose a higher labour rights risk due to their location and the nature of the goods and services procured. Contractors and suppliers identified as being at higher risk for labour rights issues are engaged to undertake a detailed assessment, developed in consultation with the Danish Institute of Human Rights, of their management system prior to the award of a contract. This assessment requires suppliers to declare whether they have in place a process to assess and manage social risks with their own suppliers. The number of assessments follows our risk-based approach and is dependent on the level of project activity and the number of new contracts awarded throughout the year. If gaps are identified, we may work with contractors and suppliers to help them understand how to close these gaps or we may ultimately consider terminating the contract. Suppliers or contractors that are required to develop a corrective action plan may be subject to onsite audits, which may be announced or unannounced, as part of Shell companies’ monitoring efforts. Audits may be performed by either Shell personnel or third-party auditors. Allegations of practices running contrary to our Supplier Principles that are raised to us will be investigated and may result in suppliers being required to develop corrective action plans backed up by onsite audits. In addition, contracts may be terminated with immediate effect if suppliers breach, or we suspect they are in breach, of the Shell General Business Principles.

254,"RADLEY
Here at Radley, we are proud of the steps we have taken to combat slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain. We consistently audit our supply chain and carefully select partners to ensure that our ethical standards are being strictly maintained and that the factories we use to manufacture our products are fair and safe places for workers.
Supply Chain Audits:
Radley uses accredited third party auditors to regularly assess our factories' compliance with our fair labour standards. One of these entities is lntertek - a leading quality assurance service provider. lntertek carries out regular audits and produces Workplace Conditions Assessment Reports (a ""WCA"") for Radley to monitor and assess the labour standards in each factory used by Radley. Each factory is rated against country and international standards and legislation and scored accordingly.
Radley expects each factory in its supply chain to reach and maintain ""High Performance"" ratings. Our most recent WCA gave an overall facility score of 93%, with the reviewed factory achieving above industry standards in each specific category.
In the event a factory fails to achieve ""High Performance"", the factory will be expected to follow
lntertek's recommendations for improvement. Radley reviews the WCA alongside the relevant factory so that it is aware of, and can monitor, the next steps being taken to improve the facility.
Supplier's Compliance with Production Standards:
In a bid to ensure compliance throughout the supply chain, Radley includes its ethical Production Standards as part of the Supply Agreement that it has in place with each supplier. These Production Standards are also included as part of the Recommended Supply Subcontractor Agreement which Radley requires all suppliers to use in the event that they wish to sub-contract any p-art of the manufacture or production of Radley products. Radley's Production Standards have been designed to ensure that workers in the factories that manufacture our products are treated ethically and work in safe conditions. Our Production Standards have been developed using the Ethical Trading Initiative's Base Code (which is derived from the International Labour Organization's principals on ethical labour) and, as such, we are confident that our Production Standards are sufficiently robust and effective in the current climate.
We use our Production Standards and Recommended Supply Subcontractor Agreement to communicate to our suppliers our expectations of how they should conduct themselves and their factories (or any factories that they use for the production of our products). Here at Radley, we will only work with supply partners who sign up to, and comply with, our approved Production Standards. A PDF copy of our Production Standards can be found here.
In the event that a supplier fails to meet our internal accountability standards and procedures for fair labour standards, we will look to take corrective action and to develop a remediation plan.

 Continuing to adapt the system for supply chain verification whereby the organisation evaluates potential suppliers before they enter the supply chain; and
 Conducting a review of its existing supply chains, expected to be completed within 2017, whereby the organisation evaluates all existing suppliers.
Training The business requires that all key staff within our supply chain complete training on modern slavery to ensure that they understand the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking infiltrating the business or its supply chains.

STIHL Statement on Slavery and Human Trafficking
As a manufacturer doing business in California and pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, STIHL Incorporated (“STIHL Inc.”) offers the following statement regarding its efforts to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain.
Corporate Responsibility: STIHL recognizes its social responsibility as part of the community in all regions in which it operates. STIHL respects the cultural, social, political, and legal diversity of societies and nations. Within the framework of the laws and regulations of individual countries and its scope of influence, STIHL strives to harmonize commercial goals with the social and ecological requirements in our business world, human rights, and the environment. These principles are part of our corporate culture and apply throughout our company. All our employees are asked to ensure these principles are observed and we expect our business partners to adhere to similar principles. A statement on the corporate principles observed by STIHL can be found here. This longstanding statement of the Principles of Social Responsibility of STIHL specifically mandates compliance with internationally proclaimed human rights and rejects any form of forced labor and child labor.
Human Trafficking: On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the state of California. The act seeks the elimination of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains and requires that companies disclose their efforts to ensure that their supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking. STIHL Inc. strongly opposes slavery and human trafficking, and would never knowingly conduct business with contractors or employees engaged in such practices.
STIHL Inc. reviews its product supply chain to evaluate human trafficking and slavery risks. At present this is done internally.
STIHL Inc. conducts supplier audits to evaluate whether suppliers comply with applicable corporate standards and principles, including those related to human trafficking and slavery. These audits review all aspects of the supply chain including environment, safety, human trafficking, child labor and other legal requirements.
STIHL Inc. maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct. The STIHL Supplier Code of Conduct establishes guidelines for the standard of ethical behavior we expect from our suppliers, and states that a supplier may not use child or forced labor. Each supplier is required to comply with this Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct is available here.
STIHL Inc. purchasing policies require that our direct suppliers certify that materials incorporated into STIHL Inc. products comply with the laws of the country or countries where such suppliers do business, which would include those addressing human trafficking and slavery. The STIHL Inc. Supplier Manual, published and distributed to suppliers every other year, encompasses the specific requirements of STIHL Inc. with reference to human trafficking, and the Supplier Code of Conduct.
STIHL Inc. provides internal training sessions for purchasing and other supply chainrelated employees regarding our policy requirements and the Supplier Code of Conduct.

We are all committed to this standard by actively supporting and applying the same basic principles in terms of human rights, fair working conditions, environmental protection as well as the fight against corruption.
Krones expects the same principles to be applied by its business partners. These principles are stipulated within the Krones Group Supplier Code.
The Krones Group operates in the UK through its subsidiary Krones UK Ltd.

Krones UK Ltd operates by the same standards and is committed to ensure that it meets its obligations in complying with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, driving out any form of Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking within its supply chain.
https://www.krones.com/en/company/responsibility/compliance.php
Code of Conduct
Within the Group, the ‘Code of Conduct’ defines the ideals for providing fair and appropriate working conditions for all the Group’s employees in all locations worldwide. Krones expects all areas of its business to meet or exceed the standards prescribed by local law and industry practices.
Training & Educating our Employees
As part of the due diligence process, within the Group, all employees must complete and pass Compliance Training and adopt the Code of Conduct. This is part of our Compliance Management system which we are rolling out and optimizing step by step. Everyone working for Krones is expected to comply with the Code of Conduct and complete all transactions efficiently and in accordance with the code. This is an obligation under employment law. Managers are responsible for ensuring that their employees are informed about the Code of Conduct and must serve as a good example within their given leadership structure.
Compliance training and updates on changes within the Code of Conduct will be provided to all employees of the Krones group.
Supplier Code of Conduct
As stipulated in the ‘Supplier Code’ Krones expects all its suppliers to follow applicable international standards such as the OECD Guidelines, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015).
The Krones Group Supplier Code stipulates standards that are expected by their suppliers relating to Child Labour, Forced Labour and Mistreatment which comply with those demanded by the UK Modern Slavery Act. Business Partners are required to agree to abide by the Supplier Code. They shall verify compliance with the standards defined in the Code at regular intervals, engage in dialogue with their business partners and allow Krones to conduct audits in this regard. In the event of non-compliance, Krones reserves the right to respond accordingly.
Krones will not knowingly support or deal with any business partner involved in slavery or human trafficking. Any breach of the principles and requirements set out in the Supplier Code will be considered a material impairment of the contractual relationship on the part of the business partner. Krones will further have the right to terminate some or all contractual relations with business partners, if the business partner demonstrably failed to fulfil the Supplier Code or does not instigate or implement improvement measures by having set a reasonable time period to do so.
Product and system audits by the Global Quality Management cover the supplier’s environmental management, occupational safety, and quality management systems. Besides weaknesses, risks, and

potential for improvement of the respective management systems, an audit also includes the supplier’s compliance with Krones’ Code of Conduct and Supplier Code. The necessary response measures are determined by the audited organisation and coordinated with those responsible for carrying out the measures. In 2017, a total of 73 system audits and 46 product audits were conducted on suppliers to Krones AG. https://www.krones.com/media/downloads/CSR2017_en.pdf and https://www.krones.com/media/downloads/180423_NFB_2017_e_.pdf
Corporate & Social Responsibility
For the Krones Group, lawful, ethical and responsible actions are an important and indispensable part of all corporate and social responsibility values. Compliance is according to instructions conducted by the entire Company and its employees. Compliance is integral to this value-oriented company organisation. Compliance means by-the-book conduct by the Company and its employees. This includes both laws and prohibitions as well as the concepts of values and rules to which Krones has committed itself. The group encourages reporting of concerns related to the activities of the organization and its business partners including those giving rise to the risk of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour or trafficking of persons. Whistleblowing procedures are outlined in the Code of Conduct and make the raising of concerns or complaints accessible to all employees.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2016 / 2017
VUR Village Trading No 1 Limited (""Village"") is publishing this statement in compliance with Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
This statement is made for the financial year ending 2016 and details the steps taken by Village during this year.
ORGANISATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
Organisational Structure
Village is part of the VUR group (the ""Group"") and our ultimate parent company is VUR Holdings (UK) Ltd (‘Holding Company’), which has its head office in the United Kingdom. This statement is made by Village as the company that actively carries out business in the UK on behalf of the Group.
Village is a UK-based company operating 28 Hotels throughout the UK. We employ around 4,000 employees. Our hotels provide full hotel services including bedrooms, spas and leisure and gym facilities with significant food and beverage offerings.
The Group has an anticipated annual worldwide turnover of £200 million in 2017 (all from within the UK).
Responsibility
We recognise that although slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking (‘Modern Slavery’), is illegal it remains a growing issue in the UK. In an increasingly global marketplace, we also recognise that all businesses have a responsibility to understand whether modern slavery and human trafficking is taking place within their businesses and supply chains and this is a responsibility we take seriously.
We are committed to making meaningful and long term improvements to workers’ employment and workplace conditions including but not limited to the prevention of forced, bonded and trafficked labour. We do this through our policies and governance, which are supported by a committed organisation and our leadership.
We also recognise that the hospitality industry can be at a higher risk of exposure to Modern Slavery for the following reasons:
1
49530041-1

Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement
 having a high percentage of staff who are from overseas;  having a transient workforce;  having a diverse supply chain.
SUPPLY CHAIN We procure goods and services directly from over 1000 first tier UK based suppliers in three main areas; Furniture, fixtures and equipment, food and beverage and operational supplies (goods not for re-sale). We have contractual relationships with all of our suppliers and a dedicated procurement department to oversee the instruction of major supplier agreements and ensure that adequate procedures are in place. We subcontract general maintenance and construction works services to a number of small providers in the UK. When building a new hotel we currently contract with one main UK based contractor who will then subcontract elements of the construction work. We have a number of low tier indirect suppliers throughout the world, primarily related to our food and beverage offering. We employ the majority of our workforce directly; we have a small number of independent agents working for Village. These independent agents tend to be IT consultants (working centrally) or personal trainers (based in the gym facilities at our hotels). All independent agents are contracted with directly. We have two franchise arrangements operating within Village, both of which are under a contractual arrangement.
OUR POLICIES
2
49530041-1

Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement
We recognise that effective policies are crucial for combatting Modern Slavery. We have an Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking Policy in place that sets out our overall approach to Modern Slavery at Village. We are committed to ensuring we are not supplied by anyone who engages in human trafficking and modern slavery. Our Right to Work Policy and Recruitment Policy are followed to ensure, as far as possible, that migrant workers are not exposed to exploitation and that the business is not exposed to the fraudulent recruitment of employees. We also operate a Whistleblowing Policy aimed at employees which encourages staff to report any wrongdoing. We intend to extend this policy to our wider supply chain. General Counsel has overall responsibility for our Modern Slavery policies.
RISK MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE In order to identify and address risks of Modern Slavery in our supply chain we have:
 Carried out a first tier risk supplier mapping exercise in order to identify suppliers that fall within an area that is at high risk of Modern Slavery, and we have addressed Modern Slavery with these suppliers by requesting copies of their policies and procedures and advising them that there will be an audit trail in place over the next year for dealing with compliance.
 Addressed Modern Slavery as a formal business risk and put in place a mitigation plan that will be reviewed at quarterly meetings and owned by Heads of Departments within the business who will manage those mitigation plans.
 Reviewed our procurement processes to identify Modern Slavery as a risk to be identified and assessed on supplier audits.
 Ensured the Right to Work policy is followed with strict compliance.  Reviewed our policies on Modern Slavery with a view to identifying the
additional policies and codes of conduct that need to be put in place and which are identified in the next steps for 2017 / 2018.

49530041-1

Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement
NEXT STEPS Following a review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to date to ensure that we are identifying and combatting Modern Slavery in our business or supply chains, we intend to take the following further steps to combat Modern Slavery during 2017 / 2018;
 Put into place a supplier code of conduct and an employee code of conduct which will clearly set out our approach to Modern Slavery and communicate to the wider business and to our suppliers how it can be identified and how we intend to deal with it.
 Produce quarterly reports to the Board assessing the risks from suppliers, employees and any other areas which could be affected by Modern Slavery and ensure mitigation plans are updated and actions identified are addressed.
 Provide wider training to the business including the launch of a Modern Slavery Awareness Programme. Such training shall be integrated into both induction and on-going learning for employees.
 Develop a more detailed process for our second tier suppliers in order to assess their risk of Modern Slavery in providing goods and services to our business.
 Review our recruitment process with the intention of ensuring Modern Slavery cannot infiltrate our business.
BOARD APPROVAL This statement has been approved by the Board of VUR Village Trading No.1 Limited and the Board of VUR Holdings (UK) Limited and is signed by Gary Davis as Director of VUR Village Trading No.1 Limited.

About Us
Telford Homes is a residential developer operating across London. The business was formed in 2000 and has been built on a platform of honesty, integrity and family values such that now it now has 230 employees. London is one of the world’s greatest cities with a robust economy, an international reputation and an excellent transport network. Telford Homes will remain focused on desirable non-prime locations in London where there is a clear imbalance between the supply of homes and the needs of a growing population.
We take pride in retaining overall responsibility for our developments using our in-house construction expertise rather than employing main contractors. This skillset is valuable to potential development partners and also helps to maintain our consistent high quality and reliable delivery.
Supply Chain
Telford Homes acts as the principle contractor on all its development projects. Its supply chain consists of: • Material suppliers from whom materials are purchased directly • Subcontractors who carryout works and trades, and purchase some building materials on behalf of Telford Homes • Labour agencies who provide temporary site operatives • Consultants • Sales agents
Material suppliers, subcontractors and labour agencies are required to complete an application in order to be accepted onto Telford Homes’ preferred supplier list. During this process suppliers are vetted to ensure that their policies and procedures reflect Telford Homes’ own corporate policies.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in any part of our business, and will engage with our supply chain to ensure that our suppliers have or adopt similar polices.
Telford Homes Plc’s Commitment on Modern Slavery is to:
• Comply with legislation and regulatory requirements • Make our Supply chain aware that we promote the requirements of the legislation • Consider modern slavery factors when making procurement decisions • Develop awareness across the business of modern slavery issues • Aim to include modern slavery conditions into tender documents • Evaluate tenders with appropriate weight given to modern slavery points • Encourage our supply chain to take their own action to prevent modern slavery
Telford Homes Plc staff will:
• Undertake awareness training • Not to engage with any of our supply chain that do not demonstrate their commitment to ensuring that slavery
and human trafficking are not taking place in their own business or supply chain
Risk assessment
Telford Homes will perform a risk assessment of its labour and contractor supply chain during FY 2016/17 to identify those contractors and labour agencies who may be at a higher risk of Modern Slavery and develop an audit schedule to review employment procedures at high risk suppliers. A further risk assessment of material suppliers will be targeted in FY 2017/18.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2017.

Organisational Structure
Fresca Group Ltd is a privately-owned company with a variety of holdings in the fresh produce industry. The business includes wholly-owned enterprises and a range of joint venture and associate businesses.
1

Modern Slavery and Ethical Trading Statement
September 2016 – August 2017
Our Business
Our companies supply customers with fresh produce. Our customers are located primarily in the UK, and include multiple retailers, processors, foodservice operators, cruise lines, caterers and other fresh produce packers.
Our physical operations are primarily based in the United Kingdom, but products are sourced both within the UK and from international suppliers.
Our Supply Chain
The route to market for the products we sell is large and complex. Temporary and seasonal labour is a common feature in our supply chain, and one that we have identified as our largest risk for potential ethical issues. We seek to identify and rank this risk by area and to implement the mechanisms we consider necessary to provide assurance of good practice or to identify specific issues.
The very broad international nature of our business brings added complexity with considerations such as language, culture, legislation and economics all being significant influences in our supply chain. Standardisation of approach is not considered appropriate or feasible at this stage, but close relationships with recognised and respected bodies in the UK and internationally help provide support for upholding expected standards.
Business Policy and Practice
We are committed to reducing the risk of slavery and human trafficking within our own business and our supply chains. We recognise that characteristics of Modern Slavery crimes are hidden and we continue to develop our policies and systems to help identify potential abuse.
Each of our companies will identify its own risks and priorities and is responsible for monitoring and auditing as necessary. Monitoring is by KPIs specific to each business.
Some parts of our business are more advanced in their monitoring procedures and have key performance indicators in place. Review and continuous improvement of the control systems becomes the priority here. Others are working to map more effectively and to develop risk assessments, effective scorecards, training and measurement. We use our group structure to help drive best practice across all our companies.
Where a risk of abuse is identified a suitable action plan will be agreed and implemented, using respected third parties to monitor and support as appropriate.
Responsibility and Training
Each of the Fresca companies has a nominated lead Ethical Manager. Relevant training and professional development opportunities will be provided. Some training has been given to some colleagues and we are assessing the best strategy for compliance and awareness training to best meet the risks identified.
Where a Fresca Group company uses an employment agency then such contracts will be overseen by individuals trained in Gangmaster Licensing Authority requirements and procedures. There will also be regular reviews and audits.
New employees within a Fresca Group company are informed of their rights during an induction session. 2

Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act) and sets out the steps that Yorkshire Building Society Group has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chains or any parts of its business.
To the extent relevant, this statement also applies to YBS’s subsidiaries and other group entities (YBS Group).

YBS is the third largest building society in the UK, with over 3 million members. YBS also trades under the brands Chelsea Building Society and Norwich & Peterborough Building Society and through our wholly-owned intermediary lending subsidiary, Accord Mortgages Ltd (Accord). YBS Group also includes YBS Covered Bonds LLP (YBS being one of the members). YBS Group is UK-based, with our principal office in Bradford. YBS is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
YBS Group’s main business is providing mortgages and savings accounts through our national network of branches and agencies, our customer contact centres and online. We also offer YBS and Accord products and related financial services through intermediaries, such as mortgage brokers, and other providers, such as insurance companies, which are themselves regulated. We provide a limited amount of finance to businesses and housing associations. YBS Share Plans is a division of YBS and administers employee share schemes for companies around the world. Procurement of goods and services is mainly via YBS, which has a broad range of UK suppliers, as well as some international suppliers.
As a mutual organisation, YBS is owned by and accountable to its members. Accord is not a mutual but is regulated by the FCA and is covered by YBS policies and controls. YBS Group’s core value is that our customers are at the heart of everything we do and it is our vision to be the most trusted provider of financial services in the UK. Given the regulated nature of our business, and the fact that we do not have extended supply chains or obtain material services from third parties located in high risk countries, we have a low risk of modern slavery and human trafficking within our business operations and supply chain; nonetheless we actively seek to improve our controls within this area.
Our policies and procedures are designed to ensure that ethical behaviour forms the bedrock of all aspects of our business. All relevant policies include appropriate references to the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking. We also operate numerous risk controls to protect our members’ money and personal information, and to ensure that our systems and services are not used to perpetrate or facilitate crime, including modern slavery. This includes a requirement for customer-facing colleagues to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity that may be linked with modern slavery or human trafficking.
We have over 3,000 colleagues, but also engage contingent workers when we need additional or specialist resources. All colleagues are employed by YBS. All of our colleagues and workers are carefully checked and vetted before they start work and all receive regular training to ensure they understand and comply with our values and policies. All of our colleagues earn at least the Real Living Wage and are eligible to join an independent union.
Our supply chain processes include both due diligence checks before we enter into contracts and regular ongoing risk monitoring. We review our approach on a regular basis and seek to improve continually through ongoing risk assessment, supplier engagement, raising awareness of issues and requirements, and by delivering training to our key staff. We continue to make significant investment in resources and systems to upgrade our procurement and

supplier risk management capability. YBS Group remains committed to doing everything we reasonably can to contribute toward helping eradicate modern slavery and human trafficking. This statement was approved by the Boards of YBS and Accord Mortgages Limited on 27 and 26 of February respectively and is signed on behalf of those Boards by Stephen White (Chief Operating Officer, YBS; Director, Accord Mortgages Limited):

California Transparency In Supply Chains Act
In Compliance with the regulations of the California Transparency and Supply Chains Act (SB 657) and the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015, the following document discloses Carter’s policies and actions relating to slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain. At Carter’s, we believe that the manufacture of our products should be performed in an ethical and socially responsible manner, and that the people who manufacture our products should be treated with dignity and respect. As part of this belief, Carter’s established a Code of Ethics as the foundation for how we conduct our business. It is a guide to help make business decisions with integrity and in a manner consistent with our values, our policies, and the law. Carter’s associates, including our business partners, vendors, and suppliers are required to adhere with our Code of Ethics. Carter’s also established a Social Responsibility Policy, which prohibits human rights abuses, such as human trafficking, forced labor, slave labor, physical abuse, restricting worker’s freedom of movement, illegal child labor, and many other aspects of worker welfare. Suppliers are required to contractually agree to follow the Policy and to ensure that their sub-suppliers comply as well. This Policy also requires suppliers to comply with local laws in the countries where they operate. In accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act summarized below are some of the additional actions we are taking within our supply chain.
1. Verification of Supply Chain and Evaluation of Risk
In addition to our Code of Ethics and Social Responsibility Policy that our suppliers contractually agree to follow, Carter’s implemented a supplier onboarding program, which outlines the requirements for existing and new suppliers. As part of this onboarding program, Carter’s evaluates the background, reputation, quality, social compliance and other factors of each new supplier prior to engagement. Factory audits are performed throughout the year as described below, and periodic strategy meetings are held between relevant departments to discuss supplier compliance, performance, and sourcing strategy. At least annually all relevant Carter’s stakeholders review and evaluate our entire sourcing strategy to identify areas of increased risk, such as political instability, unfavorable economic conditions, international events, and new foreign regulations to identify potential issues, and then we adjust our plans and audits accordingly.
2. Audits
Since we do not own any of the factories that produce merchandise for our stores, regular audits are conducted to verify that a supplier is complying with our Policy as well as to strengthen working conditions and labor practices in factories. We contract with an accredited and internationally recognized audit provider to execute these audits. Audits are conducted on an announced and semi-unannounced basis, and we retain the right to conduct unannounced audits at any time. Generally, we conduct about 400 audits in 20 countries each year. Carter’s employees who visit suppliers are also asked to assess conditions informally while on location and report back any concerns. Once a factory is audited an assessment rating is assigned, which is based on a number of factors including the frequency, severity, and probability of the finding. For major violations, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship immediately. For non-major violations, we work with suppliers to address our concerns rather than terminating the relationship as such action is unlikely to correct the underlying issue(s) and may cause further hardship on those who depend upon the employment. The assigned rating determines the timeframe for remediation. If a

on those who depend upon the employment. The assigned rating determines the timeframe for remediation. If a supplier fails to demonstrate improvement, we reserve the right to terminate the business relationship with that supplier.
3. Certification
All our suppliers are contractually required to follow our Code of Ethics and Social Responsibility Policy. Additionally, as part of our supplier onboarding program, suppliers are required to certify that materials incorporated into their products comply with our Policy, including all applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Finally, each year at our annual supplier conference, all our suppliers are reminded of and updated on any changes to our Code of Ethics and Social Responsibility Policy. The Audit and Internal Accountability sections provide descriptions of the consequences for suppliers who do not comply.
4. Internal Accountability
Carter’s associates are required to adhere to our Code of Ethics, with training and certification of compliance being conducted annually. All allegations of violations of the Code of Ethics are investigated and appropriate responsive action taken. Carter’s also maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees and contractors failing to meet company standards, and if any employee or supplier is found to be non-compliant in these areas, prompt corrective action must be taken by the employee or supplier. Regardless of the corrective action taken, Carter’s reserves the right to terminate any employee or any supplier that does not comply with our Code of Ethics or Policy.
5. Training
Code of Ethics training and certification of compliance is conducted annually for all Carter’s employees, business partners, vendors, and suppliers. Additionally, our Corporate Social Responsibility, Quality Assurance, Sourcing, Supply Chain and Merchandising teams who regularly engage with suppliers receive at least annual training on our Social Responsibility Policy. Regular strategy meetings between these departments are conducted to discuss supplier compliance, performance and sourcing strategy. CUSTOMER SUPPORT

Organisation
Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. is the manufacturer of the world’s most powerful, fastest, most exclusive and most luxurious production super sports car. Since it was established in 1909, the French luxury brand has had its headquarters at Molsheim, Alsace, where 450 Veyrons were produced from 2005 to 2015 and where the new Chiron, which is limited to 500 cars, is being hand‐crafted today. The brand, which has been part of the Volkswagen Group since 1998, employs approximately 300 people. With 34 dealers and service partners in 17 countries in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia/Pacific, Bugatti is now a global player.
Bugatti is aware of the importance of acting ethically and responsibly and provides a sustainable and fair environment for all stakeholders. This includes the establishment, maintenance and continuous improvement of working conditions within the company as well as with its business associates.
Principles
Code of Conduct
As members of the Volkswagen Group, all Bugatti employees undertake to observe the Code of Conduct that defines the behaviour expected of them towards all business associates in the light of ethical and environmental standards.
Antislavery and human trafficking policies
Bugatti has implemented antislavery and human trafficking policies to address the risk of modern slavery.
These policies inform Bugatti’s employees of matters relating to modern slavery and heighten awareness of these issues within the company. This includes the observance of applicable health, safety and employment legislation. In addition, the policies provide guidance on how to detect and report any suspected violation of human rights.
They encourage employees to respond to possible violations of human rights and to utilise the company’s whistleblower system (see below). Any violation of these policies is treated as severe misconduct and may constitute grounds for suspension or termination of the employment contract.

Whistleblower system policy
Bugatti has a whistleblower system policy applicable to all persons working for the Bugatti brand regardless of their location. All employees and business associates have access to an ombudsman service which they may use anonymously if they prefer. A special email address has been set up for this purpose: hinweisgeber.buga.r.wob@bugatti.com
Sustainability requirements for contractors
Bugatti expects its business associates to observe human rights and employment legislation in accordance with Volkswagen’s sustainability requirements for contractors. These sustainability requirements form an integral part of the contract for all Tier 1 contractors.
The sustainability principles cover human rights, the core labour standards defined by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the principles defined by GlobalCompact and the International Chamber of Commerce Business Charter for Sustainable Development.
The sustainability requirements are available in nine languages and can be downloaded from the Volkswagen Group supplier portal.
If a business associate breaches any of these conditions, the company reserves the right to terminate business relations.
Identifying risks
Potential concerns regarding modern slavery are monitored by means of a risk management system. Consequently, potential risks within the company are evaluated on a quarterly basis. This process also regularly evaluates the observance of internal policies and the VW sustainability requirements.
As an automotive OEM, Bugatti has a highly complex international value chain which it is committed to rendering fully visible. Bugatti applies the same standard of care to its Tier 1 contractors in all regions to ensure that the zero‐tolerance approach to human trafficking is observed along the entire value chain.
The same principles apply to contractors performing on‐site services at Bugatti such as construction and cleaning services. The UK government takes the view that these are industries exhibiting a heightened risk of human trafficking.
Compliance
Potential compliance risks including the risk of breaches of human rights are recorded and evaluated using the enterprise‐wide, regularly updated GRC risk process. Preventive measures are developed and corresponding compliance programmes implemented on the basis of the results. Internal auditing, security, human resources and legal departments are responsible for the necessary

investigations and reactions. Group Audit performs regular and systematic reviews of the processes utilised by the Group brands (including Bugatti) in accordance with the internationally acknowledged COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework among other things. In addition, it performs sample reviews regardless of the existence of any suspicion as well as investigations into certain suspicious cases.
Due diligence execution
Contractor self‐assessment
Contractors are asked to complete a self‐assessment questionnaire confirming that they comply with the sustainability requirements. The questionnaire has been prepared in conjunction with other automotive OEMs to ensure consistency across the entire sector. Regular quality audits are performed to determine whether the contractors have understood the sustainability requirements and have completed the sustainability questionnaire.
Sustainability audits
Bugatti can utilise an independent external service provider for selected contractors to determine whether they are working in accordance with the sustainability requirements. The results of these audits are reviewed by the department responsible for the purchasing region in question. If necessary, this department prepares a plan of action.
If any violations of the requirements are ascertained and the contractor is not willing to implement the necessary adjustments, Bugatti may decide to terminate the business relationship.
Monitoring of effectiveness
In order to ensure that contractors comply with the expected process, the Volkswagen Group performs a quarterly review of the data that contractors have disclosed in the sustainability self‐ assessment questionnaire together with data from sustainability e‐learning.
A list of all contractors that have not submitted their questionnaire is forwarded to the Volkswagen Group’s sustainability contact for the region in question. If the self‐assessment questionnaire reveals critical points with respect to ethical or environmental matters, an ad‐hoc case is recorded and forwarded to the Board of Management of the Volkswagen Group and the heads of purchasing of all brands for further investigation.

Training All Bugatti employees are able to take part in sustainability training. This is provided in the form of an e‐learning module that is available to all Volkswagen Group employees.
Summary This statement sets out a number of the measures that Bugatti takes to prevent and eliminate modern slavery in all areas of its business. It is to be updated over time to include progress made on this important matter.

MCMULLEN & SONS, LIMITED (the “Company”)
SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT
1

INTRODUCTION FROM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR Slavery and human trafficking remains a hidden blight on our global society. We all have a responsibly to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. Staff are expected to report concerns and management are expected to act upon them.
ORGANISATION’S STRUCTURE
We are a manufacturer of beer and a provider of pub and restaurant facilities. McMullen & Sons, Limited is the parent company of a wholly owned subsidiary, McMullen’s of Hertford Limited. The group has its head office in the UK and all trading outlets are in the UK.
The group has an annual turnover in excess of £36m. OUR BUSINESS Our business is organised into four business units: Managed Retail, Tenancy, Production / Distribution and Property.
OUR SUPPLY CHAINS Our supply chains includes the sourcing of raw materials principally related to the provision of food and drink.
OUR POLICIES ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk -
 Where viable, we run licenced premises as managed houses to ensure optimum control of the work environment;
 We limit the geographical scope of our licenced premises to ensure optimum supervision of the use of our properties;
 Where possible we build long standing relationships with local suppliers and tenancy customers and make clear our expectations of business behaviour;
 With regards to national or international supply chains, our point contact is preferably with a UK company or branch and we expect these entities to have suitable anti-slavery and human trafficking policies and processes. We expect each entity in the food chain to, at least, adopt ‘one-up’ due diligence on the next link in the chain. It is not practical for us
2

(and every other participant in the chain) to have a direct relationship with all links in the food chain, ultimately to the field or utility generator.  We have in place systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistle blowers. SUPPLIER ADHERENCE TO OUR VALUES We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We expect all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values. The Tenancy, Commercial and Retail Directors are responsible for compliance in their respective departments and for their supplier relationships. TRAINING To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to relevant members of staff. All Directors have been briefed on the subject. OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN COMBATING SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING We use the following key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:  Completion of House Audits by Area Managers and Business Development Managers;  Use of labour monitoring and payroll systems; and  Level of communication and personal contact with next link in the supply chain and
their understanding of, and compliance with, our expectations.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our group's slavery and human trafficking statement for the current financial year

A UN PRIORITY
Goal 8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals clearly calls for the world to take action on modern slavery:
GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
Target 8.7 Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.
At Pentland Brands we’ve prioritised six UN SDGs. Goal 8 is one of them. You can see all six here.

Modern slavery is a prevalent issue within modern supply chains. It’s not confined to developing countries or pages of history. It’s happening now and it’s happening globally.
The Ethical Trade Initiative refers to modern slavery as an overarching term used to describe:
Human trafficking A process of bringing a person into a situation of exploitation through a series of actions, including deceptive recruitment and coercion.
Forced labour Any work or services which people are not doing voluntarily and which are exacted under a threat of some form of punishment.
Bonded labour Work demanded as a means of repayment of a debt or a loan.
Slavery A situation where a person exercises (perceived) power of ownership over another person.

The term ‘modern’ is used to distinguish this more complex phenomenon from historical slavery associated with the legal possession of one person by another.
Estimates on the scale of the issue vary, largely because cases are difficult to detect. It’s been reported that between 21 million and 45.8 million men, women and children around the world are in some form of slavery.*
At Pentland Brands, modern slavery is an unacceptable issue. We state clearly in Our Standards that work should be freely chosen and we have a clear position on migrant labour in our vulnerable workers policy pack.
We recognise that human trafficking and modern slavery can be difficult to detect. But we are committed to understanding, investigating and resolving any cases that our due diligence uncovers.

1.1 Introduction from CEO Andy Long

This report, which has been approved by the Pentland Brands Board, looks at the progress we’ve made in the past year, and sets our direction for the years to come.

Being a global sportswear and footwear business means we can play a pivotal role in protecting people’s rights. Our industry is heavily reliant on people, and with that comes an inherent responsibility and great potential to contribute to economic and social development.
We have a strong history in trading ethically. We were a founding member of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), signatories to the Indonesia Freedom of Association Protocol, and, most recently, founding members of the ACT Foundation – a collaboration of brands, retailers and the global union IndustriALL pushing for living wages in our supply chains.
We have a well-established system to monitor factory working conditions in line with Our Standards. But, given that modern slavery is often a hidden issue, sometimes involving organised crime, we must continue to evolve our processes to respond effectively to it.
Building from solid foundations, in 2016 we introduced a factory assessment tool to help us focus our efforts in areas of greatest risk. We also piloted a new, and thorough investigation process involving a number of employees across our ethical trade and supply chain teams at one of our highest risk factories in Thailand.

Unfortunately, during our visit we found strong indications of trafficking and modern slavery. We are clearly disappointed with what we discovered. However, it has proved the value of our new assessment programme, and I’m pleased that we’re now working collaboratively with the factory to tackle what we’ve found. This matches the approach we’ve always had, working closely with factories to improve conditions for the people that work there, and only ending a relationship if a factory shows a lack of willingness to improve.
Transparency and collaboration will be key to tackling this issue. In 2014, we were among a group of organisations brought together by the ETI and the British Retail Consortium to encourage the British prime minister to introduce Section 54 on transparency in supply chains to the UK Modern Slavery Act. This year, alongside this report we are publishing a list of the factories where our products are assembled. This forms an important part of our commitment to embrace transparency and work collaboratively with stakeholders. Issues such as modern slavery are complex and fuelled by globalisation, so we must work together with others to raise labour standards and make a collective change.

Stock This is the supply chain that creates our consumer products, i.e. the branded stock we sell to customers. Non-stock Our non-stock supply chain is everything else we purchase – whether that be services or consumables, e.g. stationery, cleaning services, etc. Direct This means we have a relationship with the assembly factory. Indirect This means we work with agents and/or suppliers who may help with a range of things, e.g. quality control, product development, translations or factory sourcing. We still ultimately own the factory relationship and we don’t delegate any of our corporate responsibility to the agent.

Being transparent about who we source from helps us work in a more, constructive, open and collaborative way with our suppliers, customers, other brands, NGOs and civil society.
It means factories are more accountable for their standards; we can collaborate with brands that source from the same factories as us; and people can alert us if they’ve found an issue at one of our factories.

Our standards and policies
Our Standards guide the way we work and set out what we expect from our employees and suppliers. They include guidance on how to do business ethically, with integrity and with respect for people, and are available in 13 languages. See page 20 for details on how we audit factories in line with these standards.
We are developing more detailed policies to help employees, suppliers and other stakeholders interpret and implement Our Standards. These policies will make it easier to address challenges in a practical way – allowing for more transparent and collaborative conversations.
We’ve created a policy pack to help protect the rights of the most vulnerable: migrant workers, homeworkers and underage workers. It’s particularly important that suppliers understand our expectations when it comes to these vulnerable employee groups. The policy pack has been reviewed and guided by input from the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and Anti-Slavery International (ASI) and will be distributed in 2017. We take a positive approach to homeworkers. You can find out about how we’ve helped to set up stitching centres for homeworkers in India here.

Purchasing practices
We developed new manufacturing agreements in 2016 which commit our suppliers, service providers and manufacturers to tackling all human trafficking and modern slavery risks in their operations.
We’re members of the ACT Foundation Purchasing Practices Working Group and are committed to implementing good practice outcomes in our own operations.
In 2016, we began an initial review of our purchasing practices to check they don’t inadvertently have a negative impact on suppliers’ ability to provide workers with safe and rewarding employment conditions. This includes payment terms that could negatively impact the profitability of our manufacturers. For example, currently 85% of our suppliers are paid within 30 days of receipt of export documents.

Introducing new training on modern slavery
In 2016, we worked with Verité, experts in supply chain, labour and human rights issues, to develop a training package to help mitigate modern slavery.
We ran a pilot session in the UK, before training 40 people in our global supply chain team in September. The first part of the training targeted buyers, with a one-day session to help them identify and respond to potential risks. This was followed by a more advanced two-day session for corporate responsibility practitioners and auditors.

In 2017, we will extend our training to the following levels of the business:

RISK ASSESSMENT
In April of 2016 we started work on a modern slavery risk assessment tool in partnership with Lancaster University. The tool is helping us to build a modern slavery risk profile across our sourcing regions and focus our efforts where the biggest risks are.
The primary source of this information is the 2016 Global Slavery Index (GSI) published by The Walk Free Foundation. It also uses data from: ILO Data on Forced Labour (2012); The US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report (2016); Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) (2015); and Freedom in the Work Report (FITW) by Freedom House (2016).

Assessing country level risk
We used various data sources to create a country level risk profile according to:
• the prevalence of modern slavery in the country;
• the strength of government action to combat it; and
• the vulnerability of the country to modern slavery.
This map shows the risk profile of the countries our factories are based in. We’ve combined this with factory data to develop a risk profile for each factory.

3.5 Identifying issues and taking action

1.0 Introduction

2.0 Who we are

IN DETAIL
Zero tolerance: An issue that has an unacceptable impact on worker rights or conditions.
It could lead us to suspend or even end a supplier relationship if they do not immediately engage in sustainable improvement.
Critical: An issue of serious concern that could turn into a zero tolerance issue.
Minor: Less significant breaches. Alone, they can be quickly tackled. But in clusters they can identify a need for improved management practices.

Working with factories
We audit all our tier 1 assembly factories on a cyclical basis to ensure compliance with Our Standards. The audits are performed by a combination of our internal audit team and our nominated third party providers. All external auditors are individually certified social auditors. If an issue is found as part of this process, our experienced on-the-ground teams work with factories to remediate the issue and improve working conditions in line with Our Standards.
We try to avoid terminating relationships with suppliers, because that offers no benefit for the workforce. We would only exit a relationship if a factory refused to improve. We make sure we exit factory relationships responsibly, in a way that minimises any negative impact on the workforce.
During social audits conducted globally in 2016, seven instances of non-compliance under the base code ‘Employment is freely chosen’ were identified. These included instances of restriction to workers terminating their contracts, forced overtime and illegal deductions from wages. All have been remedied or are in progress.

FACTORY REVIEW PROCESS

STARTING A RELATIONSHIP

We carry out a social audit of new factories.

They must be approved before our brands can place any orders with them.

We conducted 30 initial audits in 2016.

MONITORING STANDARDS

We regularly re-audit every factory.

In 2016, we made 38 factory visits as part of this process.

IMPROVING STANDARDS

If we find areas for improvement, we make recommendations, agree an action plan and follow up to check on progress. We encourage manufacturers to include workers in the process
and to consult them on the changes.
In 2016, our in-house teams made 12 factory visits to check up on improvement progress, understand the root causes and gauge the impact on workers.

We regularly invite an independent local interviewer to join our visits and speak directly with factory employees about working conditions.

Going beyond standard auditing
While our audit protocol can give a good indication of modern slavery risks, we’re potentially dealing with concealed and sometimes criminal activities, requiring a somewhat different approach. In November 2016, we piloted an enhanced factory investigation process focused specifically on modern slavery risk indicators.
During this investigation we found 15 indicators of modern slavery and human trafficking. We’ve since put together a working group that is designing corrective plans. You can read more about this investigation here. We intend to roll out a similar investigation process to all our high risk suppliers.
Giving workers a voice
We recognise the need to provide people with a means to report incidents that they’ve either experienced or seen, especially if they feel their human rights are not being fully respected.
We’re currently refreshing our internal whistleblowing process and are looking into how we might extend this to people employed in our supplier factories.

Modern slavery is a complex emerging issue, which means many existing ethical trade audit processes – including our own – aren’t sufficient to identify all potential cases of modern slavery.

So, in 2016 we piloted a complementary investigation process to look specifically for modern slavery and trafficking indicators in one of our high risk assembly factories.

Amy Benstead, a PhD student from Lancaster University who is helping us to develop our approach, writes a first-hand account of the process.

In November we partnered with Verité and travelled to Thailand to conduct an in-depth audit focusing specifically on the risk of migrant labour. Following closely on the tail of theoretical training in September, this investigation allowed us to put what we’d learnt into practice.
The factory was identified by our assessment tool as high risk, as it employs a high proportion of international migrant workers. Unlike a standard social audit, this investigation focused on the whole employee experience – from recruitment to leaving the company – to identify potential modern slavery risks.

WHAT WE DID
We spent four days in the factory and used a variety of measures to gather information, including:
Group interviews with middle management to review: • Recruitment, selection and hiring
(inc. use of recruitment agencies) • Documentation and worker files • Company documentation including:
- Company policies - Employment contracts - Documentation and records - Any retained employee property
Worker interviews focused on: • Understanding how the migrant workers were recruited, and
how they journeyed from their home country to the factory. • Understanding their working conditions and social habits. • Asking migrants about what they expected when their contract
came to an end. Many migrants were on their second contract, so had factual experiences to report.

What we found
Throughout the process the factory management team were very cooperative and transparent. The workers were open and generally satisfied working in the factory. However, we identified some areas of concern listed below. Our Head of Sourcing and Head of Ethical Trade presented the findings to the factory’s senior and middle management. They also gave an overview of modern slavery legislation and due diligence.
TYPES OF ISSUES FOUND
Recruitment Process and Policy Recruitment Fees Indicators of Trafficking Grievance Procedures Freedom of Movement Access to Wages

WHAT WE’RE DOING

We have set up a steering group to guide the improvement programme, consisting of:
• Regional ethical trade manager – Pentland Brands • Head of Sourcing – Pentland Brands • Head of Ethical Trading – collaborating brand • Commercial Director – supplier • HR head – supplier • Factory manager – supplier
The factory has agreed to compensate recruitment fees paid by workers backdated to 1 January 2017, and will pay such fees in the future.
We have contracted a leading migrant worker expert and human rights campaigner to provide best practice guidance on building and implementing our vulnerable worker policies, operationalising our migrant worker policy throughout our supply base, and remedying risks.
We’re also in the process of contracting an expert local partner, previously engaged with remediation and migrant worker representation.
This independent non-profit organisation will provide expert help to the factory in implementing our migrant worker policy.

They will provide ongoing monitoring of policy delivery, conduct regular interviews with workers to identify any lasting debt issues, and to measure benefits the policy delivers. They will provide a whistle-blowing system, so workers can report any instances of poor practice. They will also provide training to the workers, to make sure they’re aware of their rights. The partner will provide impartial progress reports to the steering group.
This means we are close to finalising the first apparel and footwear initiative in Thailand aimed at embedding best practice migrant worker recruitment and employment practices.
Reducing risks across Thailand
As Pentland Brands, we’re working to reduce our risks across Thailand. We’ve provided our Bangkok office team with a briefing and presentation on the Modern Slavery Act, specific issues and challenges relevant to the region and our migrant worker policy. We’ve delivered training to all our Thai suppliers, and all suppliers have agreed to implement our migrant worker policy.

Reflections
We are clearly concerned about the issues we found during this investigation. However, we see the findings as a positive step towards tackling modern slavery. The pilot was, of course, challenging but it has opened our eyes to some of the risks that are not always highlighted during the social audit process. We’re now better informed about the risks in our supply chain, and we’ll be using this to improve our standard social audit, further develop our risk assessment matrix, and develop a specialised modern slavery audit process.
Collaborating with Verité
Verité are independent experts in this area and are often contracted to conduct specialised audits. This pilot audit was designed as both a ‘live’ risk assessment and a capability building exercise for our Ethical Trading team. Verité provided direction, allowing our team to be ‘hands-on’ and take the lead. This approach has helped us to improve our expertise, build our capabilities and design our modern slavery audit protocol.

“There were two things that really contributed to making this project successful – one is the openness of the Pentland team, to learn about the process, the issues and the standards; and how Pentland prepared the factory.”
“It is very important to set the tone that this is collaborative, this is working together.”
Jet Urmeneta, Capability Building Manager, Verité
“The focus & duration of this audit has allowed more collection of evidence, verification through worker interviews, more interaction with factory management, back and forth.”
“I think that has provided layers of understanding, not only in techniques for discovering issues but also insight into how and why.”
Tim Pilch, Head of Ethical Trade, Pentland Brands

LOOKING BEYOND OUR TIER 1 FACTORIES
Our current approach and strategy focuses on our tier 1 suppliers. We recognise that there is risk in the lower levels of the supply chain.
We’re currently mapping our supply chain down to tier 3, and we’re in the early stages of understanding our biggest risks and the task ahead. Our long-standing work on managing hazardous substances in our supply chain means we already have relationships with many of our tier 2 suppliers.
We will start to map our non-stock suppliers and services as part of a wider supply chain strategy.
Our due diligence in our stock supply chain is more advanced than it is with non-stock or service providers. Over the coming year we plan to take our learning from our stock supply chain due diligence and apply it to these areas of our business.

OVO GROUP LTD STATEMENT ON MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING May 2019
INTRODUCTION This Statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”). It sets out the steps taken by OVO Group Ltd (“OVO”) to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its operations and supply chains during the financial year ending 31 December 2018. OVO fully supports the aims of the Act and recognises that slavery and human trafficking is a global issue which needs to be addressed by all companies within all industries.
OVO’S STRUCTURE AND BUSINESS Founded in 2009, OVO is the UK’s largest independent energy technology company and supplier with a mission to bring affordable, clean energy to everyone. OVO’s businesses are organised into two primary areas: Retail and Kaluza. Retail Across a number of Retail brands, we serve 1.5 million customers with intelligent energy services. OVO Retail’s core business is supplying electricity and gas, and related products and services, to domestic customers within the UK. Kaluza Our intelligent grid technology company is leading the digital transformation of the electricity system. We provide software and hardware solutions as well as in-home installation services to a range of B2B partners. This statement covers all OVO subsidiaries required to provide a statement under the Act, and includes: OVO Energy Ltd (trading as “OVO Energy”, “Boost”, and “Lumo”) Spark Energy Ltd Corgi HomePlan Ltd Intelligent Energy Technology Ltd (trading as “Kaluza”) Hybrid Energy Solutions Ltd (trading as “ChargedEV”)
OVO’s WORKFORCE As of 31 December 2018, OVO employed approximately 2,000 direct employees. Some services (e.g.

As of 31 December 2018, OVO employed approximately 2,000 direct employees. Some services (e.g. facilities management, customer call centre, IT services, meter and device installations, debt collection and the manufacture of intelligent energy technology devices) are partly outsourced to third parties. Additionally, the trader network used by Corgi to perform boiler installation and other in-home maintenance services comprises independent trade professionals that are not directly employed by OVO.
OVO’s SUPPLY CHAINS During the 2018 financial year, OVO had approximately 1,230 Tier 1 suppliers. OVO’s main 2018 supplier spend related to:
the procurement of electricity and gas from our wholesale commodity provider; the manufacture, supply and installation of smart gas and electricity meters by third parties; the procurement and installation of energy technology products such as electric vehicle chargers, domestic storage heaters and smart thermostats; and the provision of software and technology platforms. Over 99% of OVO’s 2018 Tier 1 supplier spend was with suppliers based in European countries that are considered to have a low prevalence of slavery according to the Global Slavery Index.
POLICIES IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING OVO has, and is further developing, several policies that are relevant to the prevention of slavery and human trafficking, both across our own business and within our supply chain. Policies relevant to our own business Internal policies include the OVO Code of Ethics, setting out the core values and principles underpinning how we operate, and a Whistleblowing Policy, outlining our process for escalating and handling concerns and potential wrongdoing. In 2018, we initiated a review of the OVO Code of Ethics to enhance its requirements and make it more relevant to our business operations. The revised Code of Ethics, which includes an explicit commitment to eradicating modern slavery and human trafficking, will be implemented in 2019. Policies relevant to our supplier In 2018, OVO initiated the development of a Supplier Code of Conduct to set out the standards, principles and values to which OVO expects its suppliers to adhere, including a commitment to eradicating modern slavery and human trafficking. The Supplier Code of Conduct will be implemented in 2019 and will require suppliers to cascade these commitments through their supply chain.
RISK ASSESSMENT The manifestations of Modern Slavery are complex and hidden. We are developing our risk assessment process for both our own business operations and our supply chain including by focussing on countries and activities where modern slavery and forced labour concerns may exist. These include:

These include: Outsourced operations in certain countries considered to be higher-risk in terms of labour and human rights issues. Upstream raw materials sourcing for the manufacture of energy technology products such as electric vehicle chargers, domestic storage heaters and smart thermostats.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES We are committed to the highest standards of social and environmental responsibility and to conducting business in a lawful and responsible manner, including engaging with suppliers who uphold the same standards. We are continuing to strengthen our procedures for onboarding new suppliers and monitoring and engaging suppliers in-life.
ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS We recognise the need not only to tackle modern slavery but also to assess the effectiveness of the measures we have taken. During 2019 we will develop reporting mechanisms to gather data and to develop KPIs to monitor performance in this regard.
TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING Targeted training on the revised Code of Ethics, Supplier Code of Conduct and slavery and human trafficking risks will be delivered to all relevant employees during the 2019 financial year.
LOOKING AHEAD We recognise that the eradication of modern slavery and human trafficking is a continuing, collaborative and evolving process. Our priorities for the year ahead are:
Implementing a revised OVO Code of Ethics and a new Supplier Code of Conduct. Extending our risk mapping and analysis to focus on key risk areas. Developing our supplier due diligence processes. Continuing to strengthen employee awareness of modern slavery and forced labour, including through training programmes. Developing monitoring and reporting mechanisms.

273,"Home > Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017/2018
Introduction This statement has been published in accordance with Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Minor, Weir & Willis (MWW) slavery and human trafficking statement for the year commencing 1 January 2017 and ending 31 December 2017. The Act makes provisions about slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour and about human trafficking, including provision for the protection of victims. This statement articulates our policies and practices around recognising and preventing human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain.
Our Business Structure & Governance MWW employs over 200 staff in a number of locations throughout the UK. Our workers are recruited from throughout the EU and employed in the UK. MWW is one of the UK's largest handlers of fresh produce. Established in 1963, and located in Birmingham at the heart of the UK's road and rail networks, we specialise in the procurement and growing of produce from around the World and the UK for sale in the UK and continental Europe. Our Chairman and Board of Directors are ultimately responsible for delivering our commitments on tackling modern slavery in our business and our supply chain. They are supported by our heads of procurement, human resources and technical departments, who provide updates on compliance and our approach to continuous improvement.
Our Supply Chains We source over 70 types of fresh produce from approximately 250 tier 1 suppliers in more than 35 countries, and also work closely with British growers to offer local produce when in season. In 2016 we reviewed our approach to managing our Ethical Responsibilities within such a broad supply chain; firstly based on our UK businesses and their supply chains which are managed by our UK human resources department and managing directors. Secondly based on our global supply chains which are managed by our technical department. Our UK supply chain includes our main packing facility in Birmingham, our growing operation in Worcestershire and associated British growers. Within the UK operation MWW directly employs more than 200 staff but within the total MWW supply chain there are considerably more and it is the workers who are not directly employed by us or our suppliers, yet work within our supply chain, that we are obliged to protect under the new legislation. This is a complex task and therefore one that all tiers within our supply chain must agree to address when entering a supply agreement with MWW.
Our Policies The cornerstone of our approach towards tackling modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain is our Ethical Policy, which we ensure all our suppliers sign up to annually. In 2016 this has been overhauled and updated to have a stronger emphasis on modern slavery and human trafficking and the prevention of stowaway’s, and includes access to MWW Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, and UK Government codes of conduct for suppliers and hauliers.
Collaborative Action Modern slavery is a complex issue and as a result it is vital that we work closely with external stakeholders including NGO’s, charities, trade union organisations and our customers where ever possible.
We are members of the Association of Labour Providers in the UK whose aim is for “The provision of temporary labour to the UK food and agricultural sectors to be recognised as a model of good practice’’. We are also members of Stronger Together which is a UK multi-stakeholder collaboration between supermarkets, the Association of Labour Providers, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, Migrant Help, industry trade associations, NGO’s, individual employers, labour providers and trade union representatives. This initiative seeks to reduce the occurrence of forced labour, labour trafficking and other forms of hidden third party labour exploitation.

We have provided our staff in the UK with helpful guidance from Stronger Together and encourage staff to contact them through the helpline numbers if they have concerns that they or colleagues are victims of modern slavery or human trafficking.
We ensure our labour providers have a GLA licence and follow the provisions of the Gangmaster Licencing Act 2004 and accordingly adhere to their main standards. The standards are that all legal requirements are met to protect workers from poor treatment and exploitation. They cover issues such as working hours, training, terms and conditions, the national minimum wage and transport to ensure our labour providers meet the basic safety and welfare standards.
As such we adhere to these standards which collectively address our commitment to human rights and the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour.
This will be achieved through:
Raising standards – promoting a stakeholder partnership approach to improve continuously standards of labour provision and to raise labour standards beyond base compliance. Promoting growth – raising awareness of labour providers’ contribution to supply chain efficiency through effective sourcing and supply of the workforce to plant, pick and produce our food. Responsibility to workers – supporting labour providers and users to meet their legal and ethical responsibilities to the contingent workforce and to treat temporary and seasonal workers fairly and with respect. Sustainable supply – facilitating the definition and application of fair pay and charge rates that enable business sustainability and do not foster worker exploitation and tax evasion. Proportionate regulation – advocating proportionate regulation of labour provision that facilitates fair competition. Sector support – championing work and careers in UK agriculture and food production.
Since 2015 we also attend annually and participate in produce industry working groups such as the Spanish Ethical Trade Forum, who meet specifically to discuss issues and share best practice across the produce sector. In 2016 we attended several customer workshops including Co-op Ethical Trade Supplier Conference and Ethical Trade Strategy Forums. This ensures that we remain abreast of all key developments in the ethical trade space
Due Diligence and Risk Assessment As part of MWW efforts to monitor and reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our UK supply chain, our human resources department has adopted the following steps to measure the effectiveness in ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in the business or our UK supply chain.
Regular checks of the GLA website to ensure no issues have been raised against our labour suppliers. Due diligence checks on each our labour suppliers. Full audits using complier audit system from ALP with all labour suppliers. A SMETA audit carried out yearly Regular interviews with field workers.
We also adhere to standards of responsible conduct and train employees to treat each other with respect, and to adhere to laws, regulations and standards as referenced above. The spirit of this is embedded within our core values and behaviours charter.
We invest in educating our staff to recognise the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains. Through our training programmes employees are encouraged to identify and report any potential breaches of the organisations anti-slavery and human trafficking policy. Employees are taught the benefits of stringent measures to tackle slavery and human trafficking, as well as the consequences of failing to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our business and supply chains.
We are AB members of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX), a not for profit membership organisation dedicated to driving continuous improvements in responsible and ethical business practices in global supply chains. We use SEDEX to help us assess risk and manage compliance across our tier 1 supply base, who are all required to be members and complete a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) which includes indicators of forced labour, and share visibility of this information with us as part of our basic due diligence requirements.
As a minimum requirement and a pre-requisite to supply, all suppliers to MWW

must register each site of employment and fully complete a SAQ and each site must then be linked to MWW as a direct customer to provide us with transparency of employment sites, their SAQ and any independent ethical audits undertaken. MWW technical department will track the progress of suppliers in maintaining their membership status, completing and updating SAQ’s, and closing out of audit non-conformances within the agreed timescales.
With reference to our Global supply base in 2016 we have reviewed our supplier ethical risk assessment and shared our findings with each supplier based on the information they have provided to us and the information we have visible to us on SEDEX. Each supplier has been informed of their risk rating and their obligations to independent ethical audits, more specifically SEDEX Members Ethical Trading Audit (SMETA) and the frequency of such audits. SMETA provides a minimum standard for ethical audits, however, we provide a list of alternative and approved ethical audit standards that can only be substituted for a SMETA audit. Suppliers have also been made aware through the Ethical Policy of the criteria required to be met in order to reduce their risk rating and as such reduce the frequency of independent audits required.
We undertake to work closely with our suppliers, supporting them through the audit process where required, and help provide meaningful corrective action and remediation where an audit highlights any areas for concern. Where a supplier does not demonstrate a commitment to engage with MWW or local NGO’s to resolve issues relating to modern slavery and human trafficking our ultimate sanction will be to cease trading with them.
In addition in 2016 we have raised awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking with our suppliers via an informative fact sheet, and updated our supplier undertaking which sets out our technical and ethical expectations to every supplier.
Training and Capacity Building Training our colleagues and our suppliers worldwide is critical in raising awareness of the issue of modern slavery in the supply chain. The fact sheet we have produced and issued to all suppliers in 2016 gives them a simple guide with useful links to SEDEX briefing notes and guidance from the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI). Our human resources and technical staff have attended several Stronger Together workshops in 2016 as well as customer led ethical trade conferences and strategy meetings to ensure those staff remain in touch and up to date with modern slavery and the issue remains at the forefront of our business. In 2016 we created a role in the technical department that focus’s more time on ethical trading with stronger support for our suppliers.
New employees to our commercial and technical departments are briefed on modern slavery as part of their induction. This briefing includes reading of literature already mentioned, an introduction to our risk assessment and due diligence processes, so they understand from the start of their career with MWW that modern slavery and human trafficking is an issue we take seriously and will not tolerate in our supply chains. This is extremely important in driving a culture of intolerance through all departments associated with the procurement and assurances of our supply chains from the moment new colleagues join.
Performance Measurement We aim to assess continually our performance and effectiveness in tackling modern slavery through key performance indicators. In 2016 we set ourselves a target to reduce our high risk supply base through a targeted approach to SMETA auditing, working with suppliers who had never had an audit before to ensure they felt supported and capable of dealing with any issues that may arise, and visiting a percentage of those suppliers to perform pre-audit work by way of preparation.
In 2016 there were no reported incidents of modern slavery or human trafficking in the MWW UK or global supply chain.
Next Steps In 2017 we plan to reduce further our high risk supply base, increase the number of SMETA audits taking place, and encourage our primary suppliers to commit to producing their own statements on modern slavery. We will also elevate ethical risk in our supply base reviews with our commercial and procurement teams to hold a higher weighting when deciding future strategic partnerships.

The assumption of responsibility for society and future generations has a long tradition at Bosch. In the early days of the company, Robert Bosch pioneered the launch of welfare programs for associates and their families; in non-business areas, too, he played an active philanthropic role. Today, the Robert Bosch Foundation promotes health care, international understanding, welfare, education and training, art, culture, and science.
Combining the pursuit of economic objectives with consideration for social and environmental factors is a priority at Bosch. We accept that our actions must accord with the interests of society. Above all else, we place our products and services in the interests of the safety of people, the economic use of resources, and environmental sustainability.
In the following declaration, the Board of Management of Robert Bosch GmbH and the associate representatives affirm their commitment to common principles of social responsibility. The principles described in the following take their lead from the basic labour standards of the ILO.

Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking
Since 2004, the Bosch Group has belonged to the United Nations Global Compact. We support the ten principles of the Global Compact and, in compliance with the Bosch values, use the international network in order to set higher standards in human and workers’ rights, as well as in environmental protection and the fight against corruption.
As a member of the Bosch Group, Robert Bosch UK Holdings Limited is committed to this initiative’s ten global principles in the areas of human rights, working standards, environmental protection, and the fight against corruption. Neither the Bosch Group nor Robert Bosch UK Holdings Limited will work with any suppliers who have demonstrably and repeatedly failed to comply with basic ILO labour standards.

This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and outlines the work undertaken by WH Smith PLC during the year ending 31 August 2016 to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains.
Our business and supply chains
WH S ith PLC is o e of the UK’s leadi g retailers a d is ade up of t o ore usi esses – Travel and High Street.
 WHSmith Travel sells a range of products to cater for people on the move or in need of a convenience offer. As at 31 August 2016, the business operated from 769 units (2015: 736 units) mainly in airports, railway stations, motorway service areas, hospitals and workplaces. 193 of these units (2015: 163 units) are outside the UK.
 WHSmith High Street sells a wide range of Stationery, Books, Newspapers, Magazines and Impulse products, with a presence on most of the significant high streets in the UK. As at 31 August 2016, the business operated from 612 High Street stores (2015: 615 stores), located in almost all of the UK’s ost sig ifi a t high streets.
WHSmith also reaches customers online via www.whsmith.co.uk and its specialist personalised greetings cards and gifts websites, www.funkypigeon.com and www.funkypigeon.ie.
WHSmith employs approximately 14,000 colleagues.
WHSmith has operations in 24 countries, with 1188 UK stores & 193 stores in international locations, which are either operated directly by WHSmith or under a franchise or joint venture model.
WHSmith has over 1000 product suppliers, of which around 300 are suppliers of WHSmith own-brand product. The majority of these own-brand suppliers are based in China. In addition, WHSmith has over 2000 suppliers of non-merchandise goods and services.
All of the operations and supply chains described above are included within the scope of this Modern Slavery Statement.
Policies
WHS ith’s e isti g Ethi al Trade Code of Co du t a d Hu a Rights Poli is based on the Ethical Trading I itiati e’s Base Code a d covers the key issues associated with modern slavery. This policy has been updated to include a specific reference to modern slavery and foreign migrant workers. The policy is available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/corporate_responsibility.
Group Chief Executive, Stephen Clarke, is the designated Board member with responsibility for ethical trade issues and he has taken responsibility for modern slavery issues as part of this remit.

WHS ith’s Ethi al Trade Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy is included in all standard supplier contracts and agreements and in the business policies document which WHS ith’s franchise and joint venture partners are required to sign each year.
WHSmith is a long-standing member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and, as such, benefits from dialogue with other companies, NGOs and trade unions on best practice in managing and reporting on modern slavery issues. We have also had dialogue with Anti-Slavery International to advise on modern slavery risks and approach.
Due diligence
A risk assessment has been conducted looking at risk, based on operating country, sourcing country and product category, and using external guidance provided by the Global Slavery Index. During the year, we have contacted all key suppliers and business partners regarding the modern slavery legislation and required that they co fir their o plia e ith WHS ith’s updated Ethi al Trade Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy and to provide details of the approach they are taking to assess and manage modern slavery risks within their own business and supply chains. For any suppliers identified as high risk from a slavery perspective, WHSmith is holding meetings with the supplier management to review their modern slavery approach in detail and agree any improvements which might be considered appropriate.
WHSmith operates a long-established, in-depth supply chain audit process to assess and manage ethical trade risk for WHS ith’s own-brand suppliers in the Far East. Audits are conducted by our in-house, specialist audit team based in China who have been trained on modern slavery risks and conduct specific checks on modern slavery issues as part of these audits. Audits are often unannounced and include confidential worker interviews, inspection of worker accommodation and extensive document checks. Special attention is paid to modern slavery risks, especially in those sourcing countries where the risks of slavery are considered greater, for example Malaysia and India. For European suppliers, independent 3rd party audit reports are used to assess human rights and slavery risks. During 2015/16, ethical audits have not recorded any findings related to forced labour, child labour or bonded labour.
I additio to the o trols set out a o e, WHS ith’s I ter al Audit tea has ee trai ed o the requirements of the 2015 Modern Slavery Act and internal audit checklists have been updated to include modern slavery issues as part of regular Internal Audit reviews of all business divisions, including international operations and sourcing operations. Modern slavery assessments are also included as part of the checklists for unannounced audits for WHSmith franchisees.
Assessment of modern slavery risk within our supply chain
In response to the legislation, we have undertaken a review of modern slavery risks across the WHSmith Group, looking specifically at the different geographical territories we operate in and source from, and their relative risk of slavery. We are mindful that certain industries/sectors have a higher potential risk of slavery and this has been a factor in our risk assessments. Our risk assessment suggests that the majority of WHS ith’s operatio s and supply chain are in countries with relatively low perceived levels of modern slavery risk.
We have focused particular attention on China, given the large scale of sourcing that we undertake there. Our review has also focused on territories such as Qatar and Malaysia, where despite our sourcing and store operations being of more limited scale, we know that there is a higher relative risk rating for slavery. Due to the large scale of our operations within the UK, we have also focused our attention on our UK business looking specifically at the recruitment policies for distribution centre employees, and at our chilled

food supply chain, in recognition of the fact that there have been certain reported instances in the food industry of forced or trafficked labour.
Further steps taken to prevent modern slavery in our supply chains
We have updated the guidance we provide for our line managers to give them background on the modern slavery risks and help them to understand how to identify these risks for themselves and what steps they should take in such an instance.
All WHSmith employees, both directly-employed and agency staff, have access to our confidential hotline where they can report any concerns they may have about any aspect of their work at WHSmith. Training has been provided for personnel handling calls to this line to ensure that they understand how to identify any suspected cases of modern slavery and the actions they should take to escalate this so that appropriate steps can be taken.
WHSmith also funds NGO-operated confidential worker hotlines in our ten largest Chinese factories (representing over a third of our purchasing spend), providing a channel for workers to report any concerns they may have over their employment conditions. We are also working with 16 of the largest Chinese factories that we deal with on a project to help improve worker representation by setting up elected worker representative committees. These committees are a forum for workers to voice any potential concerns on any employment issues. During 2015/16, there have been no issues raised by workers through the confidential helplines or the worker committees related to modern slavery. Further detail on this project is a aila le i WHS ith’s 6 Corporate Responsibility Report available at www.whsmithplc.co.uk/corporate_responsibility.
Assessment of effectiveness in preventing modern slavery
We recognise that modern slavery risk continues to evolve and we will develop our risk assessment tools and controls in the coming year to ensure that we continue to strengthen our approach. We will focus our efforts on suppliers and WHSmith operations in those territories and industry sectors where we believe the risk of slavery to be the greatest. An area of continuing focus will be the review of slavery risks and controls within our Qatari operations and our Malaysian operations and supply chain, with specific regard to the recruitment and employment of workers. In our UK business, we will maintain a regular dialogue with suppliers operating in sectors with a higher risk of slavery, and aim to also encourage key UK suppliers to build their own capacity to manage this complex issue through participation in modern slavery training.
During the year, we are continuing to develop appropriate Key Performance Indicators to measure and report on our progress in managing slavery risks within our business and supply chains.

Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation
Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
for the financial year ended 31 March 2019
Introduction
This statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 of the United
Kingdom and sets out the steps that, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation,
(""MUTB"" or ""we"" or ""us"" or ""our"") have taken to ensure that modern slavery and human
trafficking are not taking place in our supply chains or any part of our business during the
financial year ended on 31 March 2019.
We continue to strive to maintain the highest professional and ethical standards and we expect
the same from our suppliers. Slavery and human trafficking are entirely contradictory to our
corporate values and have no place in or around our organisation, and we are pleased to
reinforce that principle through this statement.
Background
We are a financial institution incorporated and headquartered in Japan. We operate through
branches throughout the world, including in London. The global management team sits in
Japan and ensures that all of our branches comply with our corporate values and Code of
Conduct.
Policies and procedures
As a member of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (""MUFG"") we are committed to its
Code of Conduct and Corporate Vision. The Code has been enhanced and refreshed during
the year to give our staff additional guidance to MUFG's expectations in relation to their
conduct. The Code and the Corporate Vision require, amongst other things, that we respect
the human rights of all MUFG employees, act with integrity and comply at all times with the
letter and spirit of laws, regulations and rules that apply to us and combat criminal activity.
MUFG has also published a Human Rights Policy Statement which applies to the Group
globally and which articulated the Group's dedication to the respect of human rights across all
operations. This includes an expectation that our suppliers will avoid human rights violations.
MUFG's published Environmental and Social Policy Framework sets out MUFG's approach
to managing the environmental and social risks arising from the business activities of the
Group. The Framework explicitly prohibits the Group and all of its entities from providing
finance to any transaction involving the use of child or forced labour.
We operate in the UK through a branch in London. Our London branch has identified steps
and measures being taken to mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in its business
and supply chains, including:
personnel policies that aim to create a working environment that is based on core values
of respect, fairness, collaboration, team work, support, trust and transparency;
whistleblowing and grievance procedures, through which employees can raise any
concerns relating to slavery or human trafficking;
anti-bribery and anti-money laundering policies, recognising that slavery and human
trafficking can be a precursor to bribery and money laundering activity.
Due diligence processes
We do not condone or support any forms of bullying or harassment, and we are committed to
embracing diversity and building an inclusive culture where all employees are valued,
respected and their opinions count. We make our employment decisions in a non-
discriminatory manner in accordance with our obligations under the law and a commitment to
pay a living wage.
We seek to buy from suppliers whose ethical principles align with our own, and expect them
to operate fair and ethical workplaces.
Our London Branch's supplier on-boarding and risk assessment procedures (which include
country risk) identify and measure risks related to slavery and to inform the enhancement of
controls where required.
Training available
In the UK, annual training on the Code of Conduct and anti-money laundering are provided
for our employees. In addition, whistleblowing policy and process are universally applied.
Our senior management fully recognises that slavery and human trafficking are issues of
global importance and scale.
This statement has been approved by our board of directors on 26 September 2019 and has
been signed by Masatsune Okada on behalf of the board of directors.

STATEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT
Pioneer is a Japanese manufacturer of car electronics with worldwide operations. Pioneer Europe, located in Belgium, is the regional head office responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of Pioneer products within Europe. Pioneer Europe has a dedicated UK branch office that handles the sales in the UK, and for which the below statement is relevant.
In accordance with the ""Pioneer Group Charter for Corporate Operations"" Pioneer has established the ""Pioneer Group Code of Conduct"" as a set of standards, including on slavery and human trafficking, that must be observed by all employees of the Pioneer Group. These standards specify the basic requirements for responding sincerely and rapidly to stakeholders at all times, while maintaining impartial, fair and transparent relationships with them in all nations and regions where Pioneer conducts business operations.
The “Pioneer Group Code of Conduct” includes respect for human rights and international principles regarding child labor and forced labor. The “Pioneer Group Code of Conduct” is publicly disclosed and can be consulted at any time via following link: http://pioneer.jp/en/society/csr/conduct/
The Pioneer Group established a Business Ethics Committee, chaired by an outside director, to ensure legal compliance as well as thorough observance of the “Pioneer Group Charter for Corporate Operations” and the “Pioneer Group Code of Conduct.” The committee met twice in fiscal year 2017 (1 April 2016 – 31 March 2017).
A Business Ethics Hotline was established as an internal reporting system, to quickly detect and appropriately address behavior that is in violation of the “Pioneer Group Code of Conduct.” The hotline is set up outside the company to ensure the anonymity of persons making reports and to clarify the details of those reports.
During the fiscal year 2017 as a recurring training activity the “Pioneer Group Code of Conduct” was circulated to all UK employees to ensure a permanent level of awareness on Pioneer’s principles and responsibilities. All employees have submitted a confirmation that they understand and adhere to the principles laid out in the “Pioneer Group Code of Conduct”, including those related to slavery and human trafficking.

company is compliant with the statutory requirements affecting our employees and supply chain.
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
We procure a wide range of goods and services through our supply chain which includes building
contractors, subcontractors who provide labour, materials and plant, manufacturers and suppliers,
utility providers and a range of other associated trades and professional services connected with
housebuilding.
We have a stable supply chain allowing us to benefit from a significant number of long standing
trading relationships with likeminded subcontractors, suppliers and consultants who share our
values and ethics.
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We have a thorough due diligence process for managing relationships with our subcontractors and
suppliers. However, in recognition of the fact that there are always opportunities to improve such
processes, we have engaged a procurement consultancy to review our procurement processes. The
review, which is to be undertaken during the course of the financial year ending 31 March 2018 and
beyond into the financial year ending 31 March 2019, will include a review of our pre-qualification
tender process and our standard terms and conditions to ensure that our subcontractors and
suppliers are subject to appropriate due diligence processes and contractual obligations to take
steps to ensure that there is no modern slavery in their businesses or supply chains.
OUR POLICIES ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We take our responsibilities under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 very seriously and have established
a compliance team led by our Legal and Commercial departments which, with appropriate
professional advice, are currently working on implementing the following:
putting in place an appropriate anti-slavery policy designed to assist our organisation comply
with the Modern Slavery Act 2015;
ensuring our internal HR processes and policies address the potential for slavery and human
trafficking in our staffing structure; and
putting in place a confidential reporting procedure through which any concerns, including
any regarding slavery and human trafficking, can be raised.
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our
supply chains and our business, we understand the importance of providing training to our staff.
Appropriate staff training to raise awareness of slavery and human trafficking and its implications so
that staff are able to identify risk factors and report potential non-compliance will be delivered once
our policies are in place. The target date for putting in place the above policies is 1 April 2018.
OBJECTIVES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Our objectives for the coming 12 months are to make progress in developing systems for:
Identifying and assessing potential risk areas in our supply chains
Mitigating the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chain
Monitoring potential risk areas in our supply chain
Putting in place an appropriate anti-slavery policy designed to assist our organisation comply with
the Modern Slavery Act 2015
Ensuring our internal HR processes and policies address the potential for slavery and human
trafficking in our staffing structure
Putting in place a confidential reporting procedure through which any concerns, including any
regarding slavery and human trafficking, can be raised.",?
281,"Munich Re’s Statement on the UK Modern Slavery Act
This statement is made pursuant to section 54 (1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Munich Re’s 1 slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2017.

About Munich Re
Munich Re stands for exceptional solution-based expertise, consistent risk management, financial stability and client proximity. This is how Munich Re creates value for clients, shareholders and staff. The global investments are managed by MEAG (MUNICH ERGO Asset Management GmbH), which also makes its competence available to private and institutional investors.

We are convinced that our business concept can only be successfully realised in the future through sustainable and responsible action. Therefore, we are committed to respecting human rights in line with internationally accepted human rights principles2 and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

The Board of Management of Munich Re has confirmed this commitment in a position on human rights, available on the Corporate Responsibility Portal. Furthermore, Munich Re shows its commitment to human rights by participating in the United Nations’ Global ­Compact, which Munich Re joined in 2007. Its ten principles are included in our Group-wide Code of Conduct.

For several years now, Munich Re has been addressing its human rights due diligence in numerous ways. To identify human rights risks and impacts on our business and to strengthen our management systems we have continuously analysed our sphere of influence. Munich Re addresses human rights from four perspectives: Employees, Procurement, (Re)Insurance Business and Asset Management. For each of these dimensions, we have implemented a set of policies, governance instruments and internal position papers to guide our decision-making and responsible business conduct.

1	Munich Re (Münchener ­Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in München)
2 	Including the International Bill of Human Rights (incl. the Universal ­Declaration of Human Rights, the ­International Covenant on Civil and ­Political Rights and the ­International Covenant on Economic, Social and ­Cultural Rights) and the ­International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on ­Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

Employees
All of our employees contribute to our success through their skills, performance and ­dedication. That is why we are committed to investing in their development and provide all staff with equal opportunities and top-quality working conditions. Munich Re does not only adapt to the current demands of the labour market but we also understand how to meet the changing needs of our staff. Equal treatment is an inherent part of our corporate culture. Our Code of Conduct and additional self-commitments for responsible behaviour specify that we expect our employees to observe the personal dignity, privacy and personality rights of every individual. We do not tolerate any discrimination (on grounds of age, sex, ethnic origin, nationality, political opinion, race, religion or the like), sexual harassment, other personal harassment, or insulting behaviour.
Procurement
Munich Re procures many different goods and services throughout the world. Buying at best total value in terms of quality, time and costs, while ensuring compliance at all times, the procure­ ment function seeks to make a substantial and lasting contribution to the success of Munich Re. Along the entire value chain, our procurement activities are shaped by a deep sense of ­corporate responsibility. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are at the heart of our approach and we expect our suppliers to meet them as well. We have established ­P­r­ ocurement Principles to guide our interaction with our suppliers.

Munich Re’s Statement on the		 UK Modern Slavery Act

Page 2/3
The principles ensure compliance with ESG criteria and acceptance of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact in our day-to-day interaction with suppliers. To ensure compliance with the UN Global Compact within the supplier relationship, Munich Re implements a ­Corporate Responsibility (CR) clause into its standard contracts. If we believe the principles of the UN Global Compact have been breached, Munich Re reserves the right to cancel the contractual relationship by way of extraordinary termination for good cause.
Supplier registration
If a new supplier wishes to do business with Munich Re, it must first complete a supplier ­registration process. Using a self-disclosure questionnaire, it is requested to provide key ­information on the subject of sustainability. This voluntary information also addresses aspects relevant for exclusion criteria (refusal to sign the CR clause can be an exclusion criteria). Within the supplier registration process, it is mandatory for the supplier to confirm compliance with the UN Global Compact.
(Re)Insurance Business
Our business, which links us to all sectors of industry and economy, makes it possible for entrepreneurial risks to be taken. We are conscious of the fact that there is a range of ­industries and projects that may have a major impact on the environment, local communities and other stakeholder groups. The systematic anchoring of environmental, social and ­governance (ESG) aspects in core business enables us to identify these risks and, in ­cooperation with our clients, to minimise them as far as possible.
Munich Re has signed up to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) and as such is committed to making allowance for ESG aspects that are relevant for our insurance business. This applies to our products, services and internal processes. In 2013, a Group Corporate Responsibility Committee (GCRC) was established. It provides counsel on Munich Re’s corporate responsibility commitments and activities. Moreover, it evaluates and prioritises sensitive issues including human and labour rights aspects.
Also, Munich Re has established a committee for dealing with reputational risks that arise in the course of our business operations. Employees can refer critical cases to this committee prior to closing a transaction. The committee verifies the acceptability of our business ­transactions and ensures that we do not take operational decisions involving undue ­r­e­ putational risks and ESG risks. Any new topic that emerges as a sensitive business issue in these discussions is referred to the GCRC for detailed assessment and a potential extension of the existing Group-wide policies.
In 2013, we established ten generally applicable ESG aspects which explicitly include human and labour rights. These aspects help to identify industrial sectors with high ESG exposure, thus allowing ­sensitive business topics to be recognized. This helps our underwriters and asset managers to systematically incorporate consideration of ESG aspects (including aspects of human and labour rights) into the risk assessments. The GCRC has approved position papers and guidelines on various sensitive topics.
In the reinsurance sector our experts for corporate responsibility coordinate the ­implementation of the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) and the integration of ESG aspects in our core business. With this in mind, our experts on corporate responsibility provide ­relevant training for managers, underwriters and client managers in the different divisional units. In addition, a “Corporate Responsibility in Business”-coordinators’ network was established in the reinsurance sector and the coordinators were made aware of the topic. More than 600 staff members have been sensitized to ESG aspects and, in their role as multipliers, are now transferring their knowledge within their own departments, in risk assessments, client discussions and in exchanges with other units.

Asset management
Insurance companies are subject to strict security and return requirements. They have to ensure that their clients’ money is invested both safely and profitably. We take this ­responsibility very seriously. MEAG is the asset manager of Munich Re. In April 2006, Munich Re became the first German company to sign the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Since then, the PRI have served as guidelines for our investment strategy, anchoring ESG aspects more firmly in our investment process.
The vast majority of our investments meet sustainable investment criteria, as outlined in our Responsible Investment Guideline. In the asset classes of infrastructure, renewable energies, forestry and farmland, we have established an investment process which follows additional important sustainable objectives relating to investments. We regularly review our sustainability criteria for all assets, mainly using the ESG criteria of external rating agencies (including ESG criteria, thereby implicitly also human and labour rights aspects).
Wherever possible, we use the knowhow of external service providers to ensure the ­sustainability of our investments. We combine the assessments of these providers with our own investment criteria. Since 2013, our investment activities have taken into account an external ESG country rating that reflects the sustainability performance of individual ­countries. In cases where countries fail to satisfy our criteria, MEAG refrains from investing in their government bonds or the bonds of quasi-governmental organisations.
Grievance mechanisms
Employees have the opportunity to report incidents directly to their line managers, the Compliance Officer or to Internal Audit. To additionally strengthen the compliance system, an independent external ombudsman has been appointed.
Furthermore, Munich Re offers its staff members, clients, suppliers and other business partners a whistleblowing portal to report potential or actual compliance breaches. Here, relevant information can be exchanged safely and confidentially – globally and around the clock. The compliance unit receives this information and is responsible for processing it further. Employees can provide information anonymously or by using their name. If legally possible, anonymity is guaranteed.
Final Remark
We will continue to work on the implementation of the human and labour rights aspects and to consider our obligations under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017
This statement is made by Deutsche Bank AG and its relevant subsidiary undertakings pursuant to Section 54 of the United Kingdom’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”), and constitutes Deutsche Bank’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2017.
We deem the respect of human rights as an important part of our corporate responsibility and therefore we welcome the passing of the Modern Slavery Act. The requirements of the Act further reinforce our commitment to combat modern slavery and human trafficking in connection with our business activities, supply chains and investment decision-making. A cross-departmental working group was established in 2016 to identify areas where our existing policies and procedures could be improved. This work continued in 2017.
Our Business
Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Deutsche Bank is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets of € 1,475 billion as of December 31, 2017. As of that date, we employed 97,535 people on a full-time equivalent basis and operated in 60 countries out of 2,425 branches worldwide, of which 65 % were in Germany. We offer a wide variety of investment, financial and related products and services to private individuals, corporate entities and institutional clients around the world.
As of December 31, 2017 the bank was organized into the three corporate divisions: Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), Private & Commercial Bank (PCB) and Deutsche Asset Management (now DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA). More information can be found in our annual report for the financial year 20171.
Our Policies
Since November 2017 we clearly state in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics2 that we are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain or in any part of our business.
Addressing this robustly in our client transactions, as well as with our people and vendors, demands that we look to international frameworks and principles of best practice. Our Human Rights Statement3 and our Environmental and Social (ES) Policy Framework4, endorsed by a sub-committee of the Management Board, explain how we translate these frameworks and principles into day-to-day practice.
In these documents, we affirm our commitment to be guided by the various international standards and principles including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Global Compact, to which we are one of the first signatories.

Deutsche Bank
We continue to review our policies and procedures to include, where appropriate, commitments addressing slavery and human trafficking considerations in our business activities, supply chains and investment decision-making.
Our People
With regards to employees and contingent workers within the UK and elsewhere, Deutsche Bank seeks to comply with all applicable national laws, rules and regulations and, where appropriate, has implemented policies, practices and procedures to ensure compliance.
Our employees and contingent workers have access to an Integrity Hotline to report potentially unethical or inappropriate business practices anonymously. This includes reports that can be made against Deutsche Bank, our clients, our suppliers and their respective employees or any other entities or individuals doing business with Deutsche Bank. We operate an anti-retaliation policy regarding whistleblowers.
In 2017 we updated our Whistleblowing Policy with a specific wording on modern slavery and human trafficking. Furthermore, in the UK we updated the Whistleblowing section in the Employee Handbook and the Guidance for Contingent Workers to make individuals aware of the importance of reporting concerns or suspicions regarding possible human rights violations.
To ensure our people are able to recognize and respond to slavery and human trafficking risks, information was communicated in different ways including tailored training to business divisions and infrastructure functions.
Our Clients
Our ES Policy Framework facilitates the identification, assessment and management of ES risks arising from transactions and client relationships. This framework also addresses human rights issues including modern slavery and human trafficking.
To prevent serious negative human rights impacts through our business activities our business units are initially responsible for identifying potential or actual human rights risks.
To support the business units, the ES Policy Framework acts as a starting point when assessing client relationships or transactions. Its general provisions define sensitive sectors, specify the requirements for ES due diligence, and include criteria for mandatory referral to our sustainability team, Group Sustainability (GS).
Our goal is to increase awareness of ES matters across business lines, and gradually enable our business teams to better assess the ES risks so they can identify and refer transactions with an enhanced risk profile to GS.
In 2017, we continued our training programme and applications of the ES Policy Framework. This involved around 50 sessions for approximately 900 Corporate Finance employees on various topics including human rights and the expectations resulting from the Act.
In addition to the trainings, we have implemented a supplementary control mechanism into our client and transaction management system. For any transaction that triggers certain ES risk criteria, an alert will be sent to the responsible business unit to check if an involvement of GS and an enhanced due diligence might be required.
In 2017, we examined 595 clients and transactions through our ES risk management approach. In a single transaction, a combination of factors may lead to human rights risks, and

Deutsche Bank
a combination of issues, including environmental risks, can lead to a referral to GS. Therefore, we do not separately disclose the number of transactions reviewed specifically from the perspective of a human rights risk. Those referrals are part of our wider ES risk due diligence.
In addition to our internal process, our complaints handling procedures also allow clients or potential clients to report any human rights and labor matters. Our Complaints Handling Policy now also explicitly refers to the sensitive issue of Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.
Our Vendors
Deutsche Bank interacts with over 38,000 direct vendors located in more than 40 countries. It is standard practice for vendors to be required to adhere to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
For both new and existing vendors, we aim to conduct a more in-depth analysis regarding the risk that their business practices could have a negative impact on human rights. Our aim is to ensure that the vendors we use are not involved in human rights infringements, and that they have procedures in place to respect human rights and do not contribute to modern slavery and human trafficking activities.
We have included this objective as well as certain contractual requirements addressing modern slavery and human trafficking in our Master Services Agreements with vendors.
Furthermore, we have integrated specific ES criteria including modern slavery and human trafficking into a new vendor certification process to be implemented in 2018. Vendors that meet certain trigger criteria will be subject to an enhanced due diligence. GS acts as a control function in the event that there are issues to address.
In the meantime, the ES criteria required by the new vendor certification process have also been applied as part of our existing vendor risk management process. In 2017, GS reviewed 123 existing vendors based on the criteria nature of business activities and / or the country of operations. Our assessments have not generated any issues. The review process will continue in 2018.
Asset Management
To account for business operational specifics and in particular the independent fiduciary obligations of asset managers, DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA (DWS) – the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank – has established its own Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) organizational structure5, which is led by its Chief Investment Officer for Responsible Investments. DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA is a partnership limited by shares incorporated under German law (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien) with headquarter in Frankfurt am Main. Since 23 March 2018, DWS shares are listed on Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
One of the focal points of our activities in this area is to support the integration of environmental, social and governance criteria into DWS’s investment and business processes. As a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment that are supported by the United Nations, DWS aims to integrate ESG criteria in all its processes. However, given the diversity of the asset management business, different integration approaches apply to different investment teams.
5 https://dws.com/solutions/esg

Deutsche Bank
Therefore, DWS has developed proprietary ESG software to analyze, assess and rank corporations, as well as sovereigns, on a wide range of ESG indicators. Additionally, this software facilitates screenings on various ESG issues and it enables DWS to check for e.g. UN Global Compact compliance including human rights. This empowers all portfolio- and investment managers to assess risks and opportunities regarding ESG issues consistently and efficiently. This data is made available to DWS’s Active6 and Passive7 portfolio management teams in order to integrate ESG into their investment processes.
Furthermore, DWS‘s Alternative8 investment teams aim to incorporate ESG criteria into their due diligence processes. Within this division, the Sustainable Investment funds are structured to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These Sustainable Investment funds adhere to policies with regards to environmental and social issues including human rights.
Approval Procedure
This statement, which will be reviewed annually and updated as required, has been approved by our Management Board on 17 July 2018.

Modern Slavery Statement » Horizon Asset LLP

Modern Slavery Statement

Introduction

The Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) seeks to address the role of UK businesses in preventing modern slavery from occurring in their supply chains and organisations. Pursuant to section 54 of the Act, this document constitutes the modern slavery statement of Horizon Asset LLP (“HALLP”) and Horizon Asset (UK) Limited (“HAL”), HALLP’s sole corporate member (together the “Horizon UK Group” or “we”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2018 and the following period prior to publication of this statement.
Organisational Structure and Business

HALLP is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") and its sole business is investment management. HALLP has two non-UK affiliates which directly employ staff, in Hong Kong and one in Tokyo; neither of these affiliates conduct business in the UK. Horizon Asset (UK) Limited does not provide any services in the UK.
Policy on and Approach to Modern Slavery

We fully endorse the aims of the Act in seeking to eradicate modern slavery or servitude, forced labour and human trafficking and

seek to ensure that our business, employment arrangements and supply chains are free from Modern Slavery. We have adopted

and will continue to implement appropriate and reasonable measures to minimise, as far as possible, the risk of Modern Slavery

occurring anywhere in our business or supply chains and we will not knowingly deal with any organisation that is connected with

Modern Slavery in any way.

Modern Slavery Statement » Horizon Asset LLP

We acknowledge that the risk of Modern Slavery is relevant to all supply chains across all sectors. However, our business and

that of our affiliates is focused solely on investment management, which we believe to be relatively lower risk industry deploying

as it does a highly skilled labour force with extensive reliance on specialised information technology and a very limited level of

manufactured goods.

Our Supply Chain

Review and Due Diligence We take a proportionate, risk-based approach when entering in to or renewing supplier arrangements.
We have conducted a review to assess the nature and extent of the risk of modern slavery in our supply chains and business. Our supply chain is primarily comprised of institutional financial firms, financial data providers and information technology service companies that typically employ highly skilled labour in developed financial markets. Accordingly, we assess the risk of Modern Slavery in our supply chain to be low.
However, as part of our proportionate, risk-based approach we have focused and continue to focus on countries and parts of our supply chain which we consider to be relatively higher risk. The main criteria used to evaluate the risk of suppliers included the origin of manufacture or the nature of the services provided and the location these services are provided from.
As a result of this review, we identified some parts of our supply chain where the risk of modern slavery is proportionately higher. These parts include our third party suppliers who provide products and services for office buildings such as cleaning staff, security staff and courier services (“Relevant Suppliers”).
Relevant Suppliers We have undertaken checks of the Relevant Suppliers in order to confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, they are not and have not been named on any national or international watch lists and/or that their businesses are not and have not been subject to or associated with any relevant negative press.
We have also contacted any Relevant Suppliers to notify them of our commitment to eradicating modern slavery, to explain our expectations of their compliance with the requirements and spirit of the Act and to seek confirmation that they comply with the same. Where available, we review the Modern Slavery transparency statements of Relevant Suppliers and would, if deemed necessary, request other evidence of compliance such copies of relevant certifications and policies.

As a minimum, we expect all our suppliers and their supply chain to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the conduct of their business, but in addition believe that our suppliers should meet our appropriate standards with respect to labour practices and treatment. Were any concerns with respect to Modern Slavery to be identified amongst our suppliers or, to the extent apparent to us, in their supply chains, this would be escalated to senior management. Where appropriate, we will then consider termination or non-renewal of the relationship/service and take applicable steps to address our reporting obligations, if any.
Employee Awareness
All key stakeholders in our business are aware of the requirements of the Act. These stakeholders include the senior managers and limited members of HALLP and those in control of procurement for the business.
Approval Procedure and Publication
This statement has been reviewed by senior management and approved and signed on behalf of the members of HALLP and the board of directors of Horizon Asset (UK) Limited.

284,"our modern
slavery statement
hello
We started innocent in 1999 after selling our smoothies at a music festival. Since then, we’ve started making lots of other types of drinks including juices, coconut water and kids´stuff, in our quest to make natural, delicious, healthy drinks that help people live well and die old.
From humble beginnings we have grown to be one of the biggest juice and smoothie businesses in Europe with our little drinks sold across the continent. We employ about 450 people and have offices in Amsterdam, Dublin, Paris and Salzburg and our headquarters (Fruit Towers) is in London. In terms of our company structure, we have core group functions such as finance and sustainability and four regional functions which focus on the different markets where we sell our stuff. In 2016 we had a revenue of just over £300m with good growth across all major categories.
We use suppliers for many things, from delivering fresh eggs to our office for breakfast to helping us with our ads. However, the most significant area we use suppliers is to source ingredients and to make our drinks. We have an outsourced supply chain which means that we don’t own the farms that grow the fruit & veg for our drinks or the factories that blend and bottle them. We source ingredients from thousands of growers all over the world with a lot of the volume coming from Brazil, Costa Rica, Germany, Italy, Spain and Thailand. We then blend and bottle them at sites in the UK, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Thailand. Once made, we sell our drinks to supermarkets and other outlets across Europe, who sell them to our drinkers.

packaging suppliers
But there is more to us than the drinks we make. Equally important is how we go about making them. Respect for people and our planet has been built into our culture since day one. Our mantra is “tastes good, does good” and that means good for your body but also doing good in a wider sense. One of our company values is to be responsible, and we expect all of our team to think carefully about how they do business on innocent’s behalf.
Whilst we always try to do the right thing, we also know we aren’t perfect. We absolutely hate the idea of any form of slavery or trafficking being part of the making of our drinks. And whilst we have seen no evidence to suggest this is happening, we also can’t say for sure that it isn’t. To make sure we consistently hold ourselves to our own high standards, we have put together this statement (which captures our response to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015) which shares what we are doing to proactively seek out, and reduce, any chance of modern slavery or people trafficking occurring in our business or supply chains.

how we work on modern slavery
At innocent we take a holistic approach to human rights. Addressing modern slavery and people trafficking is part of a wider focus on safeguarding human rights within our business and supply chains.
We have a human rights working group that comprises of people from our sustainability and supply chain teams. The group meet quarterly and have the remit of making sure we are continuously improving the rights of people in our business and supply chains. Our head of sustainability leads this group but ultimately our operating board is responsible for compliance across the business and with suppliers.
More broadly, working on environmental and social issues is part of our culture. Every single person at innocent works on the sustainability of our business and this is formalised in objectives.
our policies and contracts
Here at innocent we believe that, while policies and contracts don’t make good bedtime reading, they are of crucial importance for setting expectations. Our human rights policy applies to our whole business and supply chain, and we have an ongoing audit programme (see below) to monitor compliance. The policy clarifies our position on diversity, freedom of association, workplace health, safety and security, working hours, wages and benefits, child labour and modern slavery. It also prohibits the use of all forms of forced labour including prison labour, indentured labour, bonded labour, military labour, slave labour and any form of human trafficking.
Our policy is guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nation Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
We have contracts with suppliers. We are rolling out a new approach to contract management in our supply base. This will ensure that all of our ingredient processing, blending, bottling and packaging suppliers have signed a master services agreement (MSA) which, amongst other things, has a section outlining our environmental and social requirements and expectations, including those outlined in our human rights policy. The MSA asks suppliers to share our code of business conduct (see below) with their employees and subcontractors and ensure they are in compliance with it. We also try and be fair with our suppliers and commit to paying them within 60 days of receiving an invoice.
We ask every new staff member to read and comply with our company code of business conduct. The code makes clear our commitment to doing business in a fair way - treating everyone, including customers, suppliers and consumers with honesty, integrity and respect. All employees are expected to comply with the code and all applicable government laws, rules and regulations.
We also have a whistleblowing procedure for employees. If they see anything that they think goes against our code of business conduct then they should report it to an appropriate member of staff.
how we assess risk of modern slavery
As part of our ongoing risk assessment process, we use external risk mapping software and desk-based research to identify environmental and social issues that may be of concern for every ingredient that we source. The software identifies risk in the areas of biodiversity, climate change, environmental laws and regulation, water stress, corruption, child labour, civil liberties, gender inequality, human rights, labour rights, land use/ conflict, as well as the prevalence and vulnerability to modern slavery. Before sourcing from a new supplier, we also ask them to complete a self-assessment questionnaire to evaluate social and environmental risk. We visit our suppliers and a representative sample of their farms and complete an ingredient risk assessment to help validate findings. Based on all of the above information, we then make decisions about which ingredients to source, where and who from, and what can be done in terms of risk mitigation.

We have also undertaken an exercise, with guidance from external experts, to assess the risk of modern slavery related to our business more broadly. We mapped all of the different parts of our business & supply chain where modern slavery could occur, from finance to IT and from supply to human resources, and then prioritised the risks areas.
Our highest risk areas are our ingredient supply chains, and to a lesser extent, the sites that blend and bottle our drinks.
The agricultural sector tends to be higher risk because our supply chains are geographically extensive and can be highly complex. The location and seasonality of each ingredient also has a big impact on the likelihood of human rights violations taking place. In certain countries forced labour is more endemic whilst seasonal crops that depend on temporary or migrant workers tend to carry greater risk.
We know that Brazil, India, Italy and Thailand are the highest risk countries for us based on country risk and how much stuff we buy from them.
For each of these higher risk countries, we have conducted more in-depth research and are developing action plans to further understand the likely risk of slavery occurring. We believe that to truly address environmental and social issues (including modern slavery) it is necessary to go beyond auditing. We want to work in partnership with our growers, and have committed to invest £1 million by 2020 in projects to achieve best practice sustainable agriculture. We will report on how these projects develop and the impact they have in the coming years.
what we are doing about it
We have a commitment as a business that our ingredient processing, blending, bottling and packaging suppliers will meet specific environmental and social minimum standards. We put this in our contracts with them and we use audits that align with international standards as the method to check that it is happening. We recognise that audits aren’t an instant fix to stopping human rights abuses, but they can be helpful in understanding where suppliers are in terms of social compliance and the management systems they have in place. They also bring home the message that we are serious about human rights and are committed to protecting workers in our supply chains.
Our commitment is to have all of the sites that process, blend or bottle our ingredients, and those that supply our packaging, audited against our Supplier Guiding Principles by the end of 2017. Any new sites have to pass an initial risk assessment process and are then given up to 12 months to undertake the audit. The audit covers all key work-based human rights including forced labour, child labour, freedom of association, discrimination, working hours and wages, health and safety, business integrity, grievance procedures, human rights management systems as well as protecting the environment.
As of March 2017, 75% of the 95 sites in the audit programme were either compliant or at various stages of closing out non-conformances. Our plan is to get this to 100% by the end of the year. Suppliers can score red, orange, yellow or green on the audit and then have a fixed amount of time to close out any non-conformances. They are generally audited every three years unless they initially score red or orange in which case they are audited again the following year. To date, we haven’t found any issues around forced labour, with the majority of non-conformances being in the areas of working hours & overtime or health & safety.
For farm level suppliers, we are using the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative’s (SAI) Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA). The assessment is internationally recognised as best practice and covers both environmental and social standards including the prohibition of any form of forced and bonded labour. We have communicated with all our ingredient processors that this is the standard that we expect them to work towards with their farmers. We have also asked them to conduct self-assessments and, where non-conformances are found, to address them. The FSA is a practical tool for understanding what is happening on farms, but using it to audit every single farm is not practical given the sheer number of farms we source our ingredients from. We are working with our supply

partners and other members of SAI to explore how we can use a representative form of sampling to best effect.
We also source some of our products from certified sources. For example, for the past ten years all of our bananas and many of our pineapples have been Rainforest Alliance Certified™. All of our primary wood and paper packaging is FSC certified. We also know that many of the farms and suppliers we source from have Global Good Agricultural Practice (Global G.A.P), ECOCERT, Organic or Fairtrade certifications. As with audits, we know that certification isn’t the silver bullet but it is an important tool for mitigating risk. Crucially for us, we buy certified products because we want to be in business with suppliers that want to be doing things in a better way.
how we work with others
We work closely with, and co-chair, the SAI fruit and nut working group. As part of this group, we have already been involved in key projects such as our strawberry project in Spain to improve water efficiency, and a project looking at oranges in Brazil. The orange project has recently developed a sustainability self-assessment tool which includes human rights issues. The tool is designed to support growers to continuously improve their production processes, and the next steps will further test the tool on the ground. Over the coming years, we foresee a great opportunity to do more work in collaboration with the group to identify and tackle issues such as modern slavery in high risk areas of our shared supply chains.
We also give 10% of our profits to charity, primarily to the innocent foundation. Since 2004 the foundation has given over £7m to projects to address hunger and food poverty. Poverty is a key cause of modern slavery and human trafficking.
how we measure performance
We know that the risk of modern slavery in our business and supply chains is constantly changing and evolving and so we are keen to put measures in place to ensure the action we are taking is having an impact.
We are in the process of formalising the indicators we will use to assess progress. They will measure:
• The percentage of our sites and farms that have been audited against SGP and FSA standards and remedial actions taken to address non-conformances
• The engagement and training of innocent staff on the issue of human rights
• Work undertaken with key suppliers to increase their effectiveness in addressing modern slavery
• Work undertaken collaboratively and money spent on projects addressing human rights
Our full set of indicators will be published in next year’s statement.
what we are doing on training
We have recently run an internal training workshop to upskill key people from across the business in modern slavery, as well as to get their help on understanding key risk areas for the business.
We have also run a session with our directors to raise their awareness of modern slavery, the legislation and our approach to addressing human rights as a business.
We recognise the need to do more with regards to training on human rights as a business, and are currently deciding on the best approach to engage employees and suppliers on the issue. We will have more to report on this front next year.

thanks for reading
This statement has been approved by the innocent Bored and we hope you have found it useful and informative. If you do have any thoughts or feedback for us, then please get in touch by emailing hello@innocentsdrinks.co.uk or stopping by Fruit Towers. Whilst modern slavery is a tough issue to tackle, it’s really important. We look forward to a busy year doing everything we can to make sure it isn’t happening in our business or supply chains.

286,"Mothercare Group Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement – FY15/16
Introduction
This statement is made in line with our obligations under the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015. These obligations comprise releasing a statement, signed by a Director, which details the steps Mothercare Group has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our business, and making this statement available in a prominent position on our website. The statement refers to our financial year ending 26 March 2016.
At Mothercare we are committed to our Corporate Responsibility programme and our social and environmental commitments sit alongside our vision to be the leading global retailer for parents and young children. This statement will cover current work relating to human rights due diligence and will also refer to future project plans in line with the government’s guidance relating to the Act.
As set out by the Act, ‘modern slavery’ encompasses the offences of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking. As employers and providers of goods and services, we acknowledge that we have a role to play in eradicating modern forms of slavery as described in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We are committed to working with partners to understand and enhance the role we can play in this.
Mothercare Group Overview
Mothercare Group plc is a global retailer for parents and young children. Our iconic brands have a long history as specialist UK retailers, with Mothercare opening its first store in 1961 and Early Learning Centre in 1974. Both brands resonate well with customers the world over. Across our UK and International businesses, we now have circa 1,500 stores across nearly 60 countries, offering a range of products from both Mothercare and Early Learning Centre.
In the UK, Mothercare and Early Learning Centre products are sold through the Group’s own multi-channel (in-store and online) retail operations and via a smaller wholesale operation.
Our international partners operate across four regions: Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Our Franchise Partners operate through over 1,270 stores, approximately three million square feet of retail space and a small but growing online presence. In addition we have a developing wholesale business for territories where we do not have Franchise Partners.
Our vision is to be the leading global retailer for parents and young children and our strategy has six pillars:
1. Become a digitally led business 2. Supported by a modern retail estate and great service 3. Offering style, quality and innovation in product 4. Stabilise and recapture gross margin 5. Running a lean organisation whilst investing for the future 6. Expanding further internationally.
Page 1 of 5

Sourcing Overview
As a global retailer of fashion and footwear, toys and home and travel products, our supply chain involves a diverse number of product types and processes. We source from approximately 500 factories. China, India, Turkey, Bangladesh and the UK account for 89% of our production sites.
We have sourcing offices in China, India and Bangladesh and our approach is to work in close collaboration with suppliers to develop stylish, quality and innovative products, which meet the needs of our customers around the world. These partnerships allow us to meet our quality, product development and responsible sourcing requirements, which are of a consistently high standard. Many of our key suppliers across all divisions have been working with Mothercare for over 10 years.
Our Approach to Slavery and Human Trafficking
Identifying and reducing the risks of slavery and forced labour in our supply chains is already an area which Mothercare Group is committed to through our Responsible Sourcing work. This is part of our broader Corporate Responsibility programme. We believe the Modern Slavery Act is an opportunity for progressive organisations to share the work they are doing and to encourage more action on this serious topic.
We acknowledge that this Act covers not only our supply chain but also our business operations and both areas will be covered in this statement.
1. Operations
We employ directly 5,496 people in the UK and 175 in Asia, not including those colleagues who work for our global network of franchisees. As part of our Recruitment Policy, our People team carries out direct recruitment wherever possible and ensures that employees have the relevant right to work documentation and suitable contractual arrangements. If we do work with recruitment agencies, we partner with reputable, preferred suppliers, which follow robust recruitment procedures.
Taking into consideration the offences of slavery, forced labour and human trafficking which are covered by the Act, we consider the areas within our operations which could present a heightened risk of such offences to be related to temporary or seasonal workers employed indirectly or on our behalf in our stores or distribution centres.
We have communicated with all employees involved in recruitment about the Modern Slavery Act and the risks associated with modern slavery in our operations and supply chain. Guidance about how to ensure they mitigate these risks and where to get more information has also been shared.
We work with reputable service providers, many of which are also subject to the Act. We have been liaising with service providers covering: temporary staff, logistics and distribution, security and guarding, customer services centres, cleaning and catering to understand their approach to the Act and learn more about their relevant policies and procedures.
Page 2 of 5

Whilst we are satisfied with the current responses to these enquiries, in FY16/17 we plan to analyse further the risk that these service providers may pose and collaborate with them on any actions as a result.
2. Supply Chain
As mentioned, our Responsible Sourcing work is most relevant to ensuring that we comply with the supply chain element of the Act. Whilst this work has been in place for many years and is on-going, we also plan to review our policies, procedures and actions in light of the Act in FY16/17. We refer to this in more detail under ‘Next Steps’.
Policies and Procedures
Our Code of Practice sets out the standards we require at all factories used to manufacture Mothercare Group products and is part of our terms and conditions of trading. As members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), this Code of Practice is based on the ETI’s Base Code and on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation. This includes specific clauses relating to:
1. Employment is freely chosen: forced, bonded or trafficked labour are zero-tolerance issues. 2. No harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed: physical or verbal harassment and
intimidation are zero-tolerance issues. 3. Living wages are paid: wages and benefits meet or exceed national legal minimum wage
and all applicable laws and regulations. Illegal deductions from wages shall not be permitted. Workers are paid at regular intervals - maximum monthly. 4. Working hours are not excessive: working hours must comply with national laws or benchmark industry standards or relevant international standards, whichever affords greater protection to workers’ health, safety and welfare. All overtime shall be voluntary, shall not regularly exceed 12 hours per week and shall always be compensated at a premium rate.
In addition to these standards, suppliers must comply with all relevant local and national laws. If there is a conflict between national law and the Code of Practice, the supplier must adhere to the standard which provides the worker with the greatest protection. In addition to this Code, the following Mothercare Group policies are relevant to the Act:
 Child Labour Policy  Migrant Worker Policy  Home Worker Policy  Sub-contracting and Sub-supplier Policy.
Our Responsible Sourcing Implementation Policy outlines how we expect suppliers to apply these policies and standards within their own businesses and supply chains.
Risk Assessment and Management
In order to implement these policies, we review and approve independent factory audits which have been carried out against our Code or against the ETI Base Code. We require this for all
Page 3 of 5

factories which produce Mothercare or ELC branded products, regardless of production country or product type. An approved independent audit is a pre-requisite of becoming a Mothercare supplier/factory.
The audits must be no older than one year and carried out by a firm from a shortlist of reputed auditing firms. Our internal teams assess these audits based on a ‘red’, ‘orange’, ‘yellow’ and ‘green’ scale and reject any new factory requests with ‘red’ findings. Any of the offenses relating to modern slavery would be graded ‘red’ according to our risk management procedures.
If an existing factory already producing for us is graded ‘red’ in an annual audit, we work closely with the supplier and factory to help them improve the findings at pace via a corrective action plan. In severe cases, if we believe no progress can be made, if progress is not forthcoming or is based on falsified records, we will end commercial relationships.
Verification and Due Diligence
It is clear from the common findings of independent audits that it is very difficult to identify sensitive issues which may be indications of modern slavery, such as retaining workers’ passports, forced overtime or bonded labour. As a result of this, we are involved in a number of other activities which support our due diligence.
Firstly, we have a team of Responsible Sourcing professionals, based in country who work closely with factories and workers to understand the daily working conditions. These teams are experts in their fields and local contexts, they take a practical, solutions-based approach, spend time understanding workers’ situations and are aware of the risks around modern slavery. This approach allows to develop a more in-depth understanding of the risks in our supply chain.
Secondly, we are involved in collaborative projects with other retailers and multi-stakeholder groups, such as the Ethical Trading Initiative, in areas where we believe there is a prevalence of vulnerable workers.
Case study:
Over the last few years, reports by NGOs have brought to light concerns about vulnerable female workers in Tamil Nadu’s garment and textile industry. As a result, Mothercare has been a member of the ETI’s programme since 2012, called TNMS (Tamil Nadu Multi-Stakeholders) which brings together diverse stakeholders to address these concerns.
This project takes a three-pronged approach: grassroots outreach; supporting regulation and inspection; and supplier engagement. Our suppliers have been closely involved in the ETI’s training, covering over 1500 workers on topics related to health and wellbeing. In 2016, the ETI launched the next stage in their training, which relates to rights and responsibilities and our suppliers are already signed up for this.
In addition to the ETI work, in 2015 we decided to include spinning mills owned by our suppliers in the scope of our internal team’s assessments and improvement work. This is due to the vulnerable nature of workers in that element of the supply chain. Although we do not have any direct commercial relationships with these mills, suppliers in general have been co-operative with these efforts and we are pleased to see improvements from this work, such as building new living quarters for workers, allowing access to mobile phones, developing and following clear leave policies and providing access to bank accounts for remote units.

Governance
Our commitment to business ethics is led from the top by our CEO. It is outlined in our Employee Global Code of Conduct and is embedded in our values to:
 ‘make it happen’ - being motivated and enabled to quickly produce fantastic results, being trusted specialists, knowing our business and customers very well;
 ‘make it better’ - making a positive difference by continually seeing what needs to be improved, and being committed to becoming the leading global retailer for parents and young children; and
 ‘do it right’ - being one team that is respectful, supportive and caring. Creating together a positive environment where everyone is welcomed into our club and can invest their energy and passion freely.
Our Corporate Responsibility governance framework ensures that monthly updates are provided to the Risk Committee, which is chaired by an Executive Director, and quarterly updates are shared with the Executive Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee as part of a wider update on risk management.
Training and awareness raising
Responsible sourcing is an element of all our employee inductions. Designers, buyers and merchandisers have also been trained on our responsible sourcing requirements. In our sourcing offices our regional teams carry out a number of internal awareness raising activities, from training to monthly updates on key performance indicators such as: factory audit grades, the percent of audit grades which have improved, the number of days until a factory must send an updated progress report.
We also carry out regular awareness raising with our key suppliers on the importance of Responsible Sourcing through our supplier conferences.
Next Steps
In FY16/17 we will continue to develop our commitments to ensuring that our supply chains and operations are free of slavery and human trafficking by working with Sancroft, who are experts in the field. We expect the project to begin in summer 2016 and focus on the following areas:
 a full supply chain and direct operations review to ensure we have identified all key risks;  a materiality grid of our strategically important products and commodities;  a gap analysis of our activities against the requirements of the Act; and  further employee trainings and workshops.

288,"Morgan Stanley Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement – Financial Year 2017
This Statement is being published in accordance with Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It outlines the steps taken by Morgan Stanley1 during the 2017 financial year to ensure that modern slavery2 is not taking place in any part of our own operations or in any of our supply chains, as well as our future plans in that regard. This Statement applies to the global operations and supply chain of Morgan Stanley and our consolidated subsidiaries.
Introduction
Morgan Stanley is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management and investment management services. With offices in more than 41 countries, the Firm’s employees serve clients worldwide including corporations, governments, institutions and individuals. Morgan Stanley’s employees procure goods and services from Morgan Stanley’s supply chain, which is made up of over 13,000 vendors (as of December 31, 2017) with the majority in the US and UK.
Morgan Stanley is committed to supporting the protection and advancement of human rights in our business and throughout our supply chain. With operations around the world, we strive to uphold global standards for responsible business, including equal opportunity, freedom to associate and bargain collectively, and the elimination of child and forced labor. We endeavor to exercise our influence in part by conducting our business operations in ways that attempt to preserve, protect and promote the full range of human rights, such as those described in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
While this Statement covers our direct operations and supply chain, we acknowledge that our client and customer base may constitute an additional area of focus; you can access more information on our approach to environmental and social risk management, human rights and anti-money laundering in our Environmental Policy Statement, Statement on Human Rights, Code of Conduct and 2017 Sustainability Report.
Our Approach
Morgan Stanley’s activities and operations are integrated globally, with core risk management policies and procedures established at a global level. Morgan Stanley’s holding company board has established an Enterprise Risk Management framework that ensures that Morgan Stanley’s risks are managed in a sound manner and escalated as appropriate. This includes management of sourcing and outsourcing, supplier selection, franchise risk and environmental and social risk.
In 2017, Morgan Stanley established an Executive Global Committee to oversee all activities related to the Modern Slavery Act, including any concerns regarding our supply chain. This was in addition to the global, cross functional working group that was created in 2016 to plan compliance with the Modern Slavery Act and implementation of enhancements to improve our ability to identify modern slavery risks.
Policies Morgan Stanley is guided by the rights outlined in the UDHR and in the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and Morgan Stanley expects that its suppliers, affiliates and partners do the same. All employees must read and acknowledge the Morgan Stanley Code of Conduct annually, which underscores our values and our commitment to ensuring a workplace that includes equal opportunity, dignity and respect, including with respect to our suppliers, affiliates and partners.

1 References to Morgan Stanley in this document are to Morgan Stanley, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated
subsidiaries. 2“Modern Slavery” means “slavery and human trafficking” as defined in Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

In addition, Morgan Stanley’s existing Global Franchise Risk and Global Environmental and Social Risk Policies outline requirements for heightened sensitivity and review where business activities or operations may be at high risk of exposure to human rights abuses. For more information on our Environmental and Social Policies, please visit the corporate governance page of our website.
Morgan Stanley also has a global Integrity Hotline providing employees with a mechanism to report concerns regarding potentially unlawful, improper or questionable conduct, including with regard to vendors or other third parties.
Due Diligence Process Morgan Stanley’s vendor due diligence program assesses risks associated with third party suppliers. In 2017, we reviewed over 1,400 companies using a risk based approach; the program reviews online public records, including an evaluation of significant litigation and regulatory actions and a negative media search of publicly available news sources. This assessment identifies, among other things, potential for risks associated with human rights and other social and/or environmental issues. Where appropriate, issues are escalated to senior management.
In 2017, Morgan Stanley took the following steps to familiarize both our employees and our suppliers with the goals and requirements of the Modern Slavery Act:
• We included online public record searches into our existing due diligence process with the aim of identifying any issues with suppliers regarding modern slavery and human trafficking;
• We reviewed our supply chain by category of goods/services provided, and notified approximately 5,500 of our suppliers about our Anti-Modern Slavery efforts;
• We included language pertaining to modern slavery in our Global Supplier Selection and Engagement Policy and related Procedures;
• We included language setting out our expectation that our suppliers do not use modern slavery in the goods or services they provide to us in new and amended supplier agreements;
• We added questions relating to modern slavery to our global RFP templates; • We conducted informational sessions and training for various internal groups, providing an overview of the
Modern Slavery Act and the Morgan Stanley 2016 Statement; • We conducted a human rights workshop for internal sourcing professionals; and • We conducted a roundtable discussion with key stakeholders regarding human rights issues within
transactions, with a focus on banking and investment management.
Ongoing Plans In the financial year ending December 31, 2018, we intend to continue work on reducing the risk of there being modern slavery and human trafficking in our operations or supply chain by taking the following steps:
• Where appropriate, we will add language detailing our expectation that our suppliers do not use modern slaves in the goods or services they provide to us in new and amended contracts;
• We will provide training to additional internal groups; and • We will review the supply chain categories that were not included in the 2017 suppler notifications and, where
appropriate, send notifications about our Anti-Modern Slavery efforts to the vendors providing those goods and services. This Statement has been approved by the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley on May 23, 2018.

In October 2005, we were the first apparel company to release the names and locations of all our active, approved owned-and-operated, contract and licensee factories that manufacture and finish Levi’s®, Dockers® and Signature by Levi Strauss™ products. We believe that making our factory list public fosters collaboration with other brands and leads to sector-wide improvement in workplace conditions.
2. Modern Slavery Policies and Supplier Contractual Requirements
Levi Strauss & Co. assesses the risk related to the apparel supply chain as a fundamental element of our standard supplier and licensee engagement process. Levi Strauss & Co.’s commitment to responsible business practices - embodied in our Global Sourcing and Operational Guidelines - guides our decisions and behavior as a company everywhere we do business. Since becoming the first multinational to establish such guidelines in 1991, Levi Strauss & Co. has used them to help improve the lives of workers manufacturing our products, make responsible sourcing decisions and protect our commercial interests. The guidelines are a cornerstone of our business relationships with hundreds of contractors worldwide.
Levi Strauss & Co. develops Country Assessments, which are part of the Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines, to help assess any country-level issues that might present concern in light of the ethical principles we have set for ourselves. The assessments assist Levi Strauss & Co. in understanding political and socioeconomic risks and opportunities associated with conducting business in specific countries, including understanding the risk of modern slavery, human trafficking and child labor. The Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines outline assessments to be conducted to identify breaches of: health and safety; human rights; legal standards; and political and social standards. They explicitly prohibit the use of forced, prison, or child labour. Levi Strauss and Co. will update the Guidelines to include specific guidance on assessing modern slavery and human trafficking risks.
In addition to our Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines, our Terms of Engagement (TOE) specify the requirements by which all of our suppliers and licensees must abide — including ethical standards, legal requirements, environmental requirements and community involvement. Our TOE also set out expected employment standards, and specifically addresses issues of child labour, forced labor, migrant workers and health and safety.
Our Sustainability Guidebook includes requirements aimed at protecting migrant workers from potential violations of their rights. The requirements cover the areas of:

• Recruitment • Employment contracts • Remuneration and benefits • Worker communications • Accommodations and food • Social activities and religious practices • Repatriation
All Levi Strauss & Co. suppliers are required to adhere to local law and the requirements contained in Levi Strauss & Co.’s Sustainability Guidebook - whichever is stricter.
Levi Strauss & Co.’s purchasing agreements require all suppliers to comply with applicable laws within the country of business, as well as our Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines and our Terms of Engagement regarding forced and prison labor.
3. Steps Taken to Assess and Manage Risk
We conduct assessments of our suppliers based on the conditions outlined in our TOE. These assessments are based on standards found in our Sustainability Guidebook, which all our suppliers receive. These assessments involve on-site and off-site discussions with workers, management interviews, review of factory records (such as timecards and payroll) and health and environmental safety inspections. Each assessment identifies areas for improvement and a detailed corrective action plan, including actions, responsible parties and timelines. Regular follow-up visits are also conducted to ensure suppliers are completing their corrective action plans on a timely basis. We conduct both announced and unannounced assessments.
Where a business partner or supplier fails to meet our standards, or comply with any of our TOE, they are given a short period to correct the problem. If, on our next inspection, certain cases of noncompliance have not been resolved within a timely manner, Levi Strauss & Co. has rights, where appropriate, to terminate the business relationship.
Levi Strauss & Co. maintains and enforces internal accountability procedures for employees and contractors regarding company standards in forced labor and human trafficking. While these accountability procedures are targeted at forced and child labour, amongst others, these will be amended to include reference to slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non-compliance, Levi Strauss & Co. reserves the right to examine the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution.
4. Due Diligence in the Business and Supply chains
We employ a full-time staff located around the world to oversee compliance, and advise on and monitor suppliers’ sustainability programs. To supplement our own monitoring efforts, we use third-party monitors to conduct regular assessments of every factory, key fabric mills and our product licensee suppliers. All third-party monitors understand the scope of our labor, environment, health and safety standards and know the local languages, laws, culture and business context of each country in which they operate. All third-party monitors must be approved by Levi Strauss & Co. Approximately 80

individual third-party monitors are approved to conduct TOE assessments in factories. In accordance with our supplier arrangements, these monitors apply the standards of either the local law, or our Sustainability Guidebook - whichever are stricter.
5. Training and Programmes
We have learned that monitoring our suppliers for compliance with our TOE is only one mechanism for improving working conditions. Levi Strauss & Co. goes beyond compliance to invest in programs that focus on improving the lives of the workers who make our products. Through our Worker Well-being initiative, we are collaborating with our suppliers and local service providers to implement programs in countries around the world. Worker well-being is a new approach to supply chain engagement that looks beyond the factory walls to improve the lives of the workers who make our products by supporting their financial empowerment, health and family well-being and equality and acceptance.
We actively support the International Labor Organization’s Better Work program , which is the leading global organization focused on protecting human rights and improving working conditions in the apparel industry. ILO Better Work makes targeted investments in our manufacturing suppliers’ workers, training apparel workers and factory management on their rights and responsibilities in the workplace. Currently, Levi Strauss & Co. participates in ILO Better Work in Cambodia, Haiti, Nicaragua and Vietnam.
Levi Strauss & Co. conducts internal training on the Worldwide Code of Business Conduct annually to ensure we provide our employees with a clear set of standards and guidance for conducting our business with integrity and the highest degree of compliance with the law. Additionally, Levi Strauss & Co. conducts internal training of our supply chain management to ensure management are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain, including human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus on mitigating risks.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our Group's slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 30 November 2016.

290,"STATEMENT AGAINST SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Dell is committed to social and environmental responsibility and has zero tolerance for slavery and human trafficking.
As part of this commitment, we are a founding member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and have
adopted its Code of Conduct (the ""EICC Code""), to which we hold ourselves and our supply chain accountable. The
EICC Code of Conduct prohibits the use of forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary
prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons. Dell considers each supplier's conduct vis-a-vis this Code when awarding
and/or renewing business with the supplier.
Dell has also published a number of other policies enforcing our commitment to international labor and human rights
standards. These principles reinforce and strengthen our commitment to the rights of our employees, workers in our
supply chain, and workers in the global community. Our policies are available online under Policies and Compliance.
Dell has taken a variety of actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in our direct
materials supply chain, including the following. Similar initiatives to those described below are in the process of being
implemented for suppliers in Dell's indirect supply chain, which includes workers who may be at greater risk in our
direct operations such as service and contract employees.
VERIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT Internal assessment of supply chain risk based on international
indices, supplier performance (e.g., audit results), and other indicators of supplier-specific risks. This risk
assessment is conducted annually, and incorporates data on human trafficking incidence from the U.S. State
Department's annual ""Trafficking in Persons Report,"" as well as other risk factors including human rights risk and
country governance and accountability. More information on our risk assessment methodology is available in our
public Supply Chain Social and Environmental Responsibility Progress Report.
AUDITS: On-site verification of EICC Code conformance through independent, third-party audits that are
announced. The third-party audits follow the EICC standard protocol, which includes an assessment of the
suppliers' policies and practices with regards to human trafficking risks and controls as well as their management
and oversight of their own suppliers, with particular emphasis on any labor brokers. We select supplier sites to
audit based on the verification and risk assessment described above. Additional detail and statistics for the last
reporting year are available in the Supply Chain Social and Environmental Responsibility Progress Report.
SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION Certification from 100% of Dell's Tier 1 and strategic Tier 2 direct suppliers, labor
brokers servicing our factory operations, and key logistics suppliers of conformance with our Supplier Principles
(which includes an expectation of conformance with all applicable laws, the EICC Code of Conduct, and related
Dell requirements) through executive acknowledgement of the Dell Supply Chain Sustainability Supplier
Expectations. These requirements include substantive sections on human trafficking. Compliance with the Supplier
Principles is also part of our standard contract language for all Dell vendors, and evaluated through the
INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY: Internal accountability standards and procedures to help confirm that employees
and suppliers meet Dell standards. This program is intended to ensure that Dell employees and suppliers are
aware of and adhere to established standards and processes. Supplier accountability occurs through mechanisms
ranging from audit corrective actions (see ""AUDITS,"" above) to Dell executive review of supplier performance and
supplier quarterly business reviews. For more detail on how accountability is built into our work with suppliers, see
the ""Protecting the most vulnerable"" and ""Championing social and environmental responsibility"" sections in the
Supply Chain Social and Environmental Responsibility Progress Report.
Dell also maintains corporate-wide accountability and grievance mechanisms (e.g., the Dell Ethics Hotline). which
are available to both employees and external parties. For additional information, see the Dell Code of Conduct.
5. TRAINING: Training Dell supply chain management professionals on the EICC Code of Conduct. This includes all
global commodity managers as well as other key relationship owners, and is conducted regularly through a variety
of training approaches, from in-person, all-day workshops to online modules. Human trafficking is consistently
covered as part of the training provided.
Dell's Global Operations organization has responsibility for implementing and monitoring compliance to all of the supply
Our focus on slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort to encourage supply chain transparency and
accountability. We will not tolerate forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison
labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons by any Dell supplier or for any other purpose. For additional information
describing the structure of Dell's direct materials supply chain and our supply chain responsibility program, see the
supply chain sections of Dell's sustainability reporting, as well as Dell's Supply Chain Social and Environmental
Responsibility Progress Report. For more information about our business, see the business description available in the

292,"This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps that YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP has taken and continues to take to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within our business and supply chain.
Modern slavery includes slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced labour. YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP (YNAP, the Group, or ‘we’) has a zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, we are fully committed to putting effective systems and controls in place to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within our business and our supply chain.
More broadly, we are committed to acting responsibly in all business dealings, from our vision right through to our day-to-day actions. We are committed to acting transparently as outlined in our sustainability report.

We are the world’s leading online luxury fashion retailer. The Group is a global company with Anglo-Italian roots, and is the result of a merger which in October 2015 brought together YOOX GROUP and THE NET-A-PORTER GROUP. Both companies have been working in the luxury fashion industry since 2000.

 Over 180 Countries served  8 Local Offices (Milan, Bologna, UK,
US, Japan, China, Hong Kong)  7 Distribution Centres (US, UK, Italy,
Hong Kong, Japan)  4,128 employees

Integrating two businesses in a rapidly transforming industry has been highly challenging. This recent transition has raised challenges in merging business structures, policies and practices. Whilst doing so is of high priority to the Group – it remains an ongoing process. As such, the scope of some of the instruments which we are currently using towards combatting modern slavery may at present cover either legacy Net-A-Porter Group, or YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A. (YNAP S.p.A.), as the following sections of this statement will make clear. We are, however, working to harmonise these practices across the Group as a whole going forwards.

The Group covers three distinct business lines to cater to their respective customer bases with unique and highly-differentiated value propositions. The Group has both in-season and off-season online stores. In-season refers to proprietary businesses where YNAP operates as an e-tailer for the season’s luxury fashion collections - and includes its multi-brand in-season online stores NET-A-PORTER and MR PORTER. Off-season refers to proprietary businesses where YNAP operates as an e-tailer mainly for the previous-season designer fashion - and includes its multi-brand off-season online stores YOOX and THE OUTNET. The Group also has numerous ONLINE FLAGSHIP STORES “Powered by YNAP”, which are based on relationships with leading fashion and luxury brands, for which YNAP is the exclusive partner.

1

We have offices and operations in the United States, Europe, Japan, China and Hong Kong, and deliver to more than 180 countries around the world. We have 8 local offices and 7 distribution centres, which employ a total of 4,128 employees.
Procurement for the multi-brand online stores is achieved via an international portfolio of suppliers of thousands of brands with different levels of involvement. We have various direct suppliers around the globe, from which we buy our stock and materials for sale. As a large global organisation, we have many other indirect supply chains, which relate to general business operations. These include - but are not limited to - transport, editorial, customer care, marketing, offices management and technology.
As well as meeting high quality standards in supply chain management, we are committed to ensuring that: working conditions in our supply chains are safe; workers are treated with respect and dignity; manufacturing processes are ethically and environmentally responsible and; the conduct of our business is based on principles of integrity, honesty and fairness.
YNAP’s Code of Ethics has been prepared to ensure that the ethical standards adopted by the Group are clearly defined and represent a fundamental part of the corporate culture. They also intend to act as the benchmark for behaviour by all those who work with the Group in the conduct of business and, in general, the performance of their activities. This includes specific reference to the exploitation of labour, and to discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation, race, class, nationality, language, religion, political and philosophical beliefs, political or union affiliation and association, health, disability and age. This Code of Ethics forms an integral part of the prevention and safeguard system currently being adopted by YNAP in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 231 of 8 June 2001, which deals with the prevention of criminal liability of legal entities in Italy.
The Group intends to promote a corporate culture characterised by honest and transparent behaviour and a robust corporate governance system. Our Whistleblowing Policy deals with all types of concerns regarding suspected or alleged violations by YNAP’s management, members of corporate bodies, and employees or third parties. It allows all aforementioned recipients an opportunity to anonymously report any suspected wrongdoings or dangers at work, which can provide evidence leading to appropriate remediation. This is detailed in the policies and procedures of the Group, with specific regard to the principles and requirements outlined in the Code of Ethics, Anti-Corruption Compliance Program, Organizational, Management and Control Model.
The prevention of forced and child labour, harsh treatment and harassment as well as principles of Freedom of Association and Non-Discrimination are key elements of the Net-A-Porter Group Supplier Code of Conduct, which is applicable to all multi-brand online store suppliers. This Supplier Code of Ethics is modelled on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, which established international human and labour rights.
YNAP S.p.A., through the Policy on Social Accountability and the Adoption of Standard “SA8000” promises to comply with the principles and requirements prescribed by international standard SA8000:2008 - the transition to the SA8000:2014 version is currently in progress. To render the commitment to comply with the requirements of SA8000 fully effective, YNAP S.p.A. has prepared and
2

disseminated benchmark procedures, which include ‘Procedure SA8000 - Remedy for child and minor labour’ and ‘Procedure SA8000 - Management of indications’.
The Group’s Policy on Procurement of goods and services not intended for sale (also known as indirect or ‘non-stock’ procurement), applicable from January 2017, aims to regulate the activities connected to evaluating and verifying the ethical, legal and financial integrity of such suppliers. As part of the process of ‘Certification and management of register of suppliers’, suppliers are asked to provide specific declarations on acceptance of the Code of Ethics, of Model 231, and compliance with the principles and requirements of International Standard SA8000.
We feel that these policies are the basis for a robust approach to combatting modern slavery and human rights and so we are not currently pursuing the creation of a separate Human Rights Policy.
Our standard terms and conditions include specific clauses and principles of the SA8000 standard which are formally brought to the attention of and acknowledged by the suppliers in a signed declaration. Compliance with the principles is a requirement of doing business with YNAP S.p.A.. The Group works with its suppliers to support their compliance, and reserves the right to take action against those that do not demonstrate sufficient commitment to the Principles, or are in breach of them.
Suppliers of YNAP S.p.A. are required to undergo audits and verifications to examine compliance with the requirements of SA8000 and implement any improvement actions. In addition, Net-A-Porter Group’s right to review and conduct audits and / or physical inspections of its suppliers’ facilities and records is included in the Supplier Code of Conduct. Currently, the Group is planning its audit activities and is defining future targets on the degree of coverage of its suppliers that may be reached through such activities.
All indirect suppliers registering with YNAP S.p.A. need to declare that they acknowledge and agree to the SA8000 policy and terms. This establishes the option for us to carry out SA8000 audits on any such entities.
We are currently examining how we can schedule the frequency of this audit process in the future, based on the level of supplier risk.
Selected categories of suppliers to Net-A-Porter, i.e. packaging, editorial and private labels have been asked to register on SEDEX, the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange organisation that aims to driving improvements in ethical and responsible business practices in global supply chains, and complete the self-risk assessment. The output will be used to perform an internal risk assessment exercise aimed at identifying those vendors that will be subject to audit verifications. Currently this does not cover YNAP S.p.A. suppliers. YNAP S.p.A. suppliers, however, are subject to SA8000 obligations as previously mentioned. Consequently, we believe that YNAP as a whole is equipped with practices aiming to
3

highlight and combat modern slavery.
Net-A-Porter Group has considered industry specific materiality regarding human rights, which can be more significant with regard to in-season product supply chains. The Group is currently working on the renewal of its certification to the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC), taking into consideration the recent merger and the organisational changes which have occurred. This would then mean the management system for the YNAP Group will be certified to RJC standards by the end of 2017.
Net-A-Porter Group has identified a further high risk sourcing area of ‘dirty gold’. We address this via our Supplier Code of Ethics. This requires that all suppliers of gold provide assurance that it has been mined in a manner which respects human and labour rights.
Going forwards, we will be working with an external partner to develop an algorithm-based procedure to determine the risk level of our suppliers, based on a number of factors including their role and location. Our external partner will then provide risk monitoring for the highest risk suppliers – and we will work to develop our own practices for monitoring the medium and lower risk suppliers.
We understand the importance on providing regular training on human rights and modern slavery. Within YNAP S.p.A., all employees receive training in the SA8000 standard. We provide informal, ongoing, demand-based support to suppliers following initial SA8000 training in response to any questions or issues raised. We are currently defining training requirements to cover additional training sessions for other teams which we consider to work in high risk areas. We are also developing a training scheme which will communicate the whistleblowing policy to all employees of YNAP. Furthermore, we provide training on the RJC standards to all logistics personnel.
In order to assess the effectiveness of measures taken, the Group will further improve the set of key performance indicators already monitored for the SA8000 standard and will report on them in future Modern Slavery Statements. This will include at least the following areas:
- Staff training: including the number of staff trained, the number of supplier organisations trained, and the level of training which core staff and supplier staff have received
- Audits - Cases of whistleblowing - Remediation cases
YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP continues to develop its approach to human rights. We are confident that the actions we will take to assess the risk levels of our suppliers will help us to monitor them appropriately to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of modern slavery. Additionally, we are committed to
4

continued harmonization of the scope of our policies and practices, and the extension of training for employees and our suppliers. Beyond this commitment, the Group will continue to discuss the extension of SA8000 at Group level, and the formalisation of our SA8000 audit process. This statement was approved by the Board of Directors of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A. and The Net-a-Porter Group Ltd. Gianluca Gaias Security, Risk & Compliance Director April 2017

As signatories to the United Nations Global Compact and our longstanding commitment to comply with the
provisions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions concerning abolition of slavery and forced

against exploitation and to strive toward eradication of forced, bonded, and slave labor.
We expect that all our partners within our supply chain comply with our zero tolerance policy on human trafficking

Taking an ethical approach to business under all circumstances guarantees longevity. Success and sustainable
development in our markets depend on the trust of our customers, employees, shareholders, and commercial and
social partners. This trust is built over time and has to be earned day in and day out. Ethics in a business
environment covers many issues that may sometimes appear contradictory. This is especially true when speaking
about a group of brands operating on every continent, in countries with different cultures, at varying stages of
economic development. However, these differences can be structured through a small number of simple but
powerful shared principles, which in the spirit of responsibility and common sense should guide our actions.

its Code of ethics. Beyond these audits and checking procedures, we work to establish lasting partnerships with
our suppliers and sub-contractors, and support them through training skills and development programmes and

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the branch's

Chiba Bank Ltd, London Branch is an overseas branch of the Chiba Bank Group, a Japanese regional bank.
London Branch engages in wholesale banking activity.
The branch's supply chain consists of office and premises-related supplies and professional services. In most
cases suppliers are UK based and the branch does not procure any goods or services directly from any countries
which are at a high risk of modern slavery or exploitation.
The Chiba Bank London Branch has taken the following steps during the year to 31 March 2019 to ensure that
slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in any of its supply chains or in any part of its own business:-
The branch continues to review its risk assessment on an annual basis and has concluded that its exposure to
modern slavery and human trafficking continues to be low taking account of the nature and volume of its
activities, the countries with which it has business relationships and its limited supply chain. There have been no
significant changes to its supply chain or business activities in the year under review.
The branch is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in its supply chains or

OUR APPROACH TO SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
The Society has zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking and is committed to taking all
reasonable steps to ensure that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains
Because of the nature of the Society's business and its supply chains, following careful consideration,
we consider that the risk of the presence of slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains is low.
However, the Society is not complacent in relation to these issues.
Our policy is to require all our suppliers to comply with applicable legal requirements, including in
relation to modern slavery and human trafficking. The Society's Procurement Policy states:
""Modern slavery - Suppliers will ensure that employees are treated fairly and ethically, and that
there is no slavery, servitude, forced/compulsory labour, or human trafficking.
Forced Labour - Suppliers will not use any forced labour, which means any work or service
performed involuntarily under threat of physical or other penalty. Suppliers shall respect the
freedom of movement of its workers and not restrict their movement by controlling identity papers,
holding money deposits, or taking any other action to prevent workers from terminating their
Child Labour - Suppliers will not directly (or indirectly through the use of its subcontractors) employ
Diversity and Inclusion - Suppliers will hire, compensate, promote, discipline, and provide other
conditions of employment based solely on an individual's performance and ability to do the job.
Suppliers will not discriminate based on a person's race, gender, age, nationality, marital status,
When bidding for new appointments, suppliers are required to confirm their compliance with these
requirements. Following appointment, we operate a programme of supplier relationship
management activities. Where any concerns arise, a full assessment is made and appropriate actions
are taken to address those concerns. We see our approach to Procurement and Supplier
Relationship Management as an effective measure in carrying out our zero tolerance approach to
We provide all of our colleagues with training that's relevant to them. We also ensure our
management teams have additional support which includes guidance to make sure our recruitment
process is consistent and our approach to managing suppliers is effective. We have given, and will
continue to give, extra training to colleagues who regularly work with and have a level of operational
responsibility for managing our third party suppliers on the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We regularly review our approach to tackling modern slavery. This helps us engage with suppliers to
identify any ethical trading issues and incidents of modern slavery or human trafficking and take

Modern Slavery Act 2015 (UK) FY2018 Statement
27 September 2018 Toll Holdings Limited (Australian registered Company Number 006 592 089 and its subsidiaries) (“Toll”) is a world-class integrated global logistics provider - and proudly part of Japan Post – with over 40,000 people in more than 50 countries.
Our Business
Toll provides customers across the globe with an enormously diverse range of transport services and logistics solutions: Global Forwarding: provides a full suite of international freight forwarding from complex supply chain solutions to port-toport freight forwarding, specialising in Asia inbound and outbound trade lanes. Global Logistics: specialist contract logistics division, which provides a broad range of sophisticated transport, warehousing and value-added services around the Asia Pacific region, including warehouse logistics, mining services, energy logistics, dedicated transport services, liquid distribution, relocation management, remote and resource logistics, aviation services and helicopter services. Global Express: provides express freight within Australia and New Zealand.
Toll also provides operational services, including linehaul and Toll People.
Our Policies
Toll invests time and expertise in ensuring that it makes a positive contribution in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates. To that end, we have developed a range of company policies, including in the areas of business ethics, workplace relations, occupational health & safety and environmental management. Toll considers that, on the whole, this suite of policies provides the appropriate environment so that we work to live up to our ethical standards and do not knowingly allow human slavery or abuse to enter our business or supply chain.
Employees/Recruitment
Toll’s governance documents that address the types of activities contemplated under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (UK) include: Toll Group Code of Practice; Toll Group Anti-Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery Policy;

Toll Group Ethical Employment Policy; Toll Group Pre-Appointment Screening Policy; Toll Group Diversity Equal Opportunity Policy; and Toll Group Protected Disclosure Policy.
Suppliers
Toll’s procurement process involves a range of suppliers across multiple countries. Toll is committed to ethical business practices. We respect human rights and take steps to ensure that human slavery or abuse do not knowingly enter our supply chain. The Toll Group Supplier Code of Practice includes the requirement to comply with all employment laws and ethical labour policies. All Toll contractors, consultants, vendors and suppliers must comply with Toll’s Supplier Code of Practice. Toll’s standard procurement terms and conditions make it a condition of engagement that any third party suppliers do not engage in activities that are inconsistent with the Supplier Code of Practice. The Supplier Code of Practice reserves the right for Toll to audit suppliers and their operations. Toll can take action deemed appropriate, including termination, if suppliers do not follow the Supplier Code of Practice. The Toll Group Code of Practice and the Toll Group Supplier Code of Practice can be found here: https://www.tollgroup.com/about/policies-procedures/toll-code-practice
Our Compliance Framework
Toll’s policies are supported by Toll’s compliance framework, which comprise the following: 1. Compliance reporting – regular compliance reporting is provided by management to Toll’s Board of directors and Board committees. 2. Staff training - Toll provides training to its staff to reinforce compliance with Toll’s Ethical Employment Policy. The training is required to be conducted with new and existing staff. 3. Audit and Assurance - Toll undertakes an internal audit and assurance program which evaluates control and compliance processes on a risk basis. Depending on the risk assessment, such audits may include compliance with regulatory risks and company policy associated with labour laws, working hours, employee pay levels, and adherence to employee ‘right to work’/work permit requirements. 4. Incident monitoring and escalation - Toll operates a global Disclosure Hotline which enables employees and contractors to report suspected misconduct anonymously and via an independent reporting line. Fraud, improper conduct (including dishonest, illegal or corrupt conduct) or Code of Practice breaches relating to employees, agents, contractors or suppliers can be reported through the Disclosure Hotline. All reported allegations are reviewed and appropriate investigations conducted. This may result in corrective actions, disciplinary actions and learnings.
Assessing our Risk and Priorities
In relation to the risk of slavery and human trafficking, during the reporting year, Toll took steps to: Develop the Toll Group Anti-Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery Policy, which was adopted by the Board in September

2018; Finalise the Compliance / Business Integrity and Security Threat and Vulnerability Assessment, including consideration of human trafficking and modern slavery as a compliance threat, and input from the Global Slavery Index. This assessment will inform our ongoing business integrity program, as appropriate; and Undertake a review of the Australian employee screening processes and is preparing to implement enhancements including widening the scope of right to work verification to include all employees, contractors and subcontractors in Australia. Toll’s long term goal is to review each operational jurisdiction and roll-out employee screening processes as appropriate. Subsequent to the reporting year, Toll has taken steps to: Update the Toll Group Code of Practice, to reflect Toll’s commitment to human rights and preventing human slavery or abuse from knowingly entering its supply chain; Initiate a review of its Australian subcontractor engagement and on-boarding processes, which will include consideration of compliance with human rights and ethical working conditions requirements. Toll’s long term goal is to progress this to an international review; and Initiate a review of supplier due diligence processes to identify and prioritise potential risk areas across the operational divisions and supply chains.
Continuous Improvement
Toll will continue to review and update its policies, practices and procedures as required to maintain appropriate safeguards against any mistreatment of persons involved in its supply chain or its business.
Training and Awareness
Toll conducts online and face to face compliance training with its employees to reinforce compliance with the Toll Group Code of Practice and supporting policies. The training is conducted with new and existing employees. This training advises employees of ethics and legal principles that contribute to a culture of legal awareness and ethical practice within Toll.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015(UK) and constitutes Toll’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending on 31 March 2018. Enquiries should be directed to Toll’s Global Head of Security at compliance@tollgroup.com.

Infineon Technologies Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Status March 2017
Infineon Technologies AG is a world leader in semiconductor solutions that make life easier, safer
and greener. Microelectronics from Infineon is the key to a better future. In the 2016 fiscal year
(ending September 30), the Company reported sales of about €6.5 billion with some 36,300
employees worldwide. Infineon is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (ticker symbol: IFX) and
in the USA on the over-the-counter market OTCQX International Premier (ticker symbol: IFNNY).
We cooperate with numerous suppliers who provide us with materials and services, or who
manage parts of our supply chain. Only in close co-operation with our suppliers to optimize the
whole value chain, we will achieve sustainable competitive advantages in the future.
The ""California Transparency in Supply Chains Act"" of 2010 and the ""United Kingdom Modern
Slavery Act"" of 2015 require certain businesses to provide disclosure concerning their efforts, if
any, to address the issues of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. The disclosures
are intended to provide consumers the ability to make better choices about the products and
services they buy and the companies they support.
As reflected in our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact we respect and observe the
internationally proclaimed human rights, including the rights to personal dignity and privacy. As set
forth in our Business Conduct Guidelines as well as in our Principles of Purchasing, we shall not
condone human rights abuses, neither in the form of direct nor beneficial nor silent complicity. We
strictly oppose any form of human trafficking and slavery and do not tolerate any form of forced
labor, bonded or involuntary prison labor. All work is performed without coercion of any kind and
can be terminated by each employee by means of appropriate resignation.
Effective risk and opportunity management is central to all of our business activities and plays an
important role in implementing the strategic targets - namely achieving sustainable, profitable
growth and preserving our financial resources through efficient employment of capital.
We conducted various evaluations in the area of human rights at our manufacturing sites around
the world. On the basis of these evaluations we concluded that our activities are in compliance with
the International Bill of Human Rights and with the conventions and principles of the International
Labour Organization (Fundamental ILO Conventions).
In accordance with our Business Conduct Guidelines and our Principles of Purchasing the above-
mentioned principles shall apply to both internal cooperation and conduct towards external
partners. Therefore we expect our suppliers to be committed to the same values. Infineon requires
its suppliers and vendors to comply with all valid laws including those dealing with human rights as
well as fair business practices. These and other expectations towards suppliers are reflected in our
Principles of Purchasing, which are binding for our suppliers.
A long-term partnership between Infineon and its suppliers is a core element of our corporate
philosophy. In the course of this partnership our suppliers are managed centrally in a supplier
management portal where data is updated as necessary. This system is also used for supplier
evaluation. The compliance with our requirements in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) is highly relevant when selecting new suppliers, evaluating existing suppliers, and also for
future supplier development.

At Infineon, suppliers have to answer a CSR questionnaire which includes social and human rights
questions among others. These questionnaires are then evaluated by Infineon specialists. In case
any deviation is identified, this will be discussed directly with the supplier. Those suppliers which
could mean a risk for Infineon are classified as ""red light"" and therefore cannot be registered in
SAP for ordering or contract processes and do business with Infineon. The supplier must
implement measures immediately to solve the issues addressed and is blocked until those
measures are positively assessed by the experts.
If any answers appear to be unacceptable, Infineon reserves the right to audit a supplier. Infineon
will apply appropriate legal measures, up to and including the termination of its employees and
contractors, where company standards are not met. So far Infineon has not used third party
verifications nor independent or unannounced audits.
Infineon provides mandatory training focused on our Business Conduct Guidelines to all
employees and managers worldwide, in particular to those with direct responsibility for supply
chain management. The training includes, among other topics, work-related standards and
principles as well as fair business practices.
All employees, business partners, customers or other stakeholders who would like to report
possible violations of national regulations or internal guidelines can make their report to the
Infineon Integrity Line, openly or anonymously. The Integrity Line is available to employees,
suppliers, customers and other third parties, and also considers local languages in addition to
English. Infineon treats all reports confidentially and has a clear non-retaliation policy.
Infineon is further evaluating appropriate auditing, verification and certification practices and
processes to ensure the aims mentioned in this document.

Modern Slavery Act Statement
Lindt & Sprüngli (UK) Limited strongly condemns human trafficking and slavery and remains committed to ensuring that our supply chains are free from any form of modern slavery.
This statement has been prepared in accordance with section 54 of the UK's Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out the steps taken by Lindt & Sprüngli (UK) Limited to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains.
Our business and supply chains
Lindt & Sprüngli UK is a fully owned subsidiary of the Lindt & Sprüngli Group. The Lindt & Sprüngli Group is globally active in developing, producing and selling chocolate products in the premium quality segment. With its extensive and innovative global and local range of finest quality chocolate, it is present in around 120 countries worldwide. Lindt & Sprüngli is committed to managing sustainability impacts that emerge from its operations along the entire value chain (sourced, produced and consumed). We report on an annual basis about the progress made with regards to corporate sustainability; the report is published on the Corporate Website to provide stakeholders with comprehensive information about Lindt & Sprüngli’s goals, measures and progress made.
Our policies
We operate a number of policies to ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner. These include:
 The Lindt & Sprüngli Supplier Code of Conduct which requires all of our suppliers to comply with applicable national and international laws and regulations, including those related to human trafficking and slavery, and including the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 The Lindt & Sprüngli Business Code of Conduct which ensures all members of management, supervisors and employees demonstrate a level of professionalism and maintain high ethical standards when conducting business and when dealing with customers, suppliers and the general community.
 Our Equal Opportunity Employment policy which is applied to the recruitment and subsequent employment of all employees at Lindt & Sprüngli UK Ltd.
 Our Whistleblowing policy which ensures all employees at Lindt & Sprüngli UK Ltd know that they can raise concerns about practices within our business or supply chain, or how colleagues are being treated, without fear of reprisals.
Due diligence of suppliers and supply chain
We regularly assess risks of non-compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, or ask a third party to assess the risks in specific supply chains. Where necessary, we implement concrete programs to support suppliers in reaching and maintaining compliance with the standards we require.
Audits
Under our Supplier Code of Conduct, we reserve the right to conduct (or have a third party conduct) audits of suppliers and their facilities to verify compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Suppliers we define “at risk” for non-compliance with any aspect of our Code, including the requirements related to human trafficking and slavery, are subject to assessments, audits and/or verification visits by independent parties.

In certain programs, we also have internal monitoring/control systems in place, covering a wider range of suppliers (up to 100% of suppliers for certain supply chains). Examples are: China Supplier Development Program; Lindt & Sprüngli Farming Program for cocoa beans from Ghana, Ecuador and Madagascar; Hazelnut suppliers/farmers in Turkey; and palm oil suppliers.
Supplier certifications
Our Supplier Code of Conduct also requires suppliers to sign a Compliance Declaration, stating that they: (1) have received and commit to fully comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct and its principles and requirements; (2) agree that we or a third party may carry out periodic, audits on their facilities; and (3) will communicate effectively the contents of the Code to their employees, agents, subcontractors and suppliers and ensure all measures required are implemented accordingly. Failure to comply may result in Lindt & Sprüngli ceasing to do business with offending suppliers.
Employee accountability
All Lindt & Sprüngli employees are required to adhere to our Business Code of Conduct, which includes compliance with all laws and regulations. The CEOs of the Lindt & Sprüngli Group companies are responsible for ensuring that employees are informed and educated about the Business Code of Conduct.
Furthermore, the CEOs are expected to enforce strict adherence to the rules and regulations of the policy. Our disciplinary policy permits a range of measures, from corrective actions up to termination of relationships with employees involved in any similar misconduct. All employees are expected to report any suspicion or knowledge they may have of any slavery or human trafficking in any part of the business, and we have a whistleblowing policy in place at Lindt & Sprüngli UK Ltd to encourage this.
Training
Relevant employees, and suppliers (up to farmer level) receive regular training on our Supplier Code of Conduct, including the relevant portions relating to human trafficking and slavery, as exemplified in our Lindt & Sprüngli Farming Program in Ghana. Our employees at Lindt & Sprüngli UK Ltd complete an on-line assessment to check their understanding of our Business Code of Conduct and training is given where employees do not meet the required level of understanding.
Performance indicators
We will be able to measure the effectiveness of the steps that we are taking to ensure that slavery and/or human trafficking does not take place within our business or supply chain by:
 supporting suppliers in reducing risks;  the completion of audits;  the use of issue/grievance reporting mechanisms ;  requiring suppliers to sign Compliance Declarations;  requiring relevant employees to undertake training;  ensuring our Codes of Conduct and other relevant policies and practices are reviewed and updated
regularly and communicated clearly to all employees and suppliers

I. Abercrombie's Structure, Business & Supply Chain
Abercrombie & Fitch (“Abercrombie” or the “Company”) is an international retailer specializing in men’s and women’s apparel, personal care, and accessories. In the UK, Abercrombie stores (which includes the Hollister brand), are operated by AFH Stores UK Limited, a subsidiary of Abercrombie & Fitch Europe SAGL and Abercrombie & Fitch International, Inc., respectively. Abercrombie designs merchandise and relies on third-party manufacturers to assemble goods commensurate with the Company’s quality standards. Our third-party manufacturers are located world-wide.
II. Abercrombie's Policies in Relation to Slavery & Human Tra cking
Policies
Any form of forced servitude is contrary to Company values. Abercrombie will not tolerate forced labor, slavery, or human tra cking. This is re ected in policies including our Commitment to Social Sustainability, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Vendor Code of Conduct. These policies re ect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and implementing and enforcing e ective systems and controls to reduce the risk of any slavery and human tra cking taking place any where in our business or supply chains.
As stated in our Commitment to Social Sustainability, “Abercrombie & Fitch is proud of our commitment to international human and labor rights, and to ensuring that our products are only made in safe and responsible facilities. We partner with suppliers who respect local laws and share our dedication to utilizing the best practices in human rights, labor rights and workplace safety. Abercrombie & Fitch believes that business should only be conducted with honesty and respect for the dignity and rights of all people.”
Further, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics binds all employees to the following: “We also believe in respecting and protecting human rights wherever we operate. Ensuring that our products are only made in safe and responsible facilities is important to us. We only partner with third parties who respect local laws and share our dedication to upholding human and labor rights, as well as workplace safety…We never allow the use of child or forced labor in any of our operations or facilities or by our vendors or their subcontractors. We never participate in or condone human tra cking or slavery of any kind. We will never permit exploitation of children; physical, verbal, or emotional abuse; or involuntary servitude.”

Finally, our Vendor Code of Conduct speci cally communicates to our vendors: “Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human tra cking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors.” Each vendor that receives Abercrombie business must acknowledge this.
Ensure Appropriate Policies Exist and Human Rights Policies are Updated
Our policies are reviewed and updated regularly to con rm content remains relevant and consistent with the Company’s strong commitment to human rights and ethical labor practices in particular. Our Vendor Code of Conduct was last updated in 2015. Our Commitment to Social Sustainability was last updated in 2013. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics was last updated in December of 2015.
Suspicious Behavior and Reporting
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, employees who witness suspicious behavior within the business, or in our supply chains, are trained to reach out to their manager, Human Resources representative, or the Company’s Chief Ethics and Compliance O cer or Legal department. Employees are also encouraged to raise issues and concerns about suspected violations of the company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics through the use of the Company's ethics hotline. This is a con dential hotline that allows associates to report their concerns anonymously, either by phone or online. The hotline is available to all associates in our stores and corporate o ces world-wide.
Our partner vendors are required to follow our Vendor Code of Conduct, which requires conformity with local laws and carries certain additional standards. Speci cally prohibited actions include:
Holding Documents (e.g., Passport, work permit, etc.) Forced overtime without pay or penalty Physical abuse of employees Verbal abuse of employees Unauthorized deductions from pay Not paying required bene ts Hourly rates (regular or overtime) below legal limit
Vendors are also encouraged to contact members of the Sustainability team at Abercrombie with any questions. The Abercrombie Sustainability team has employees in the US and Hong Kong who have responsibility for assisting on such

inquiries.
Finally, Abercrombie uses third-party auditors to inspect factories (see section on How We Minimize Risk Using Internal and External Resources, below). Auditors are trained to recognize “hard” and “soft” indicators of forced labor or servitude. This includes not only checking worker identi cation to verify age, but also identifying the suspicious behaviors described above.
III. Due Diligence Processes in Relation to Preventing Slavery and Human Tra cking in Abercrombie's Business and Supply Chains
High Risk Areas
Those areas we have identi ed as highest risk for human tra cking or forced labor are the factories in our international supply chain. Often, we source materials or production in countries which seek economic development through foreign trade or investment in manufacturing (for example China, Vietnam, India, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Guatemala). We take proactive steps to ensure that we are working with the most responsible vendors, factories, and mills, in order to combat forced labor and human tra cking.
Although human tra cking and forced labor could arguably occur at other stages of the retail process – for example, in store or Home O ce environments – we feel that certain characteristics inherent in these environments, together with Abercrombie's policies and approach, reduce that risk compared to earlier stages in the supply chain. In particular, our stores and Home O ce bene t from strong relationships with Human Resources, systemic work veri cation measures, and a well-trained employee population. These forces give us con dence that these environments are lower-risk for forced labor and human tra cking than other stages, such as our partner factories abroad, and allow us to focus our e orts on these higher-risk areas.
How We Minimize Risk Using Internal and External Resources
In terms of internal resources, our Company leadership is committed to industry best practices in labor and human rights. Our Sustainability department supports that commitment, and has since its inception in 1999. Our Sustainability department operates with a dual charter of protecting environmental and social imperatives in our supply chain and product lifecycle. This department disseminates and updates our policies, solicits employee engagement with social and environmental initiatives, and generally advances the agenda of Corporate Social Responsibility in the United States and abroad.

Externally, we leverage independent third-party auditing rms to ensure our partner factories adhere to their promises in the Vendor Code of Conduct. These monitoring
rms employ and provide experts who are knowledgeable in local law, attuned to factory risks, and speak local language(s) to perform audits. Using auditors with this level of expertise helps us to minimize risk in our factories abroad.
When we engage a new third party monitoring rm, one or more employees from our Sustainability department may accompany auditors from the monitoring rm to ensure they fully understand and follow our Vendor Code of Conduct.
Auditors visit our partner factories annually or biennially and administer a full audit with every visit. Certain high risk factories or new facilities may receive more frequent audits. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, con dential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age veri cation, etc.). To maintain the integrity of the audit, the Company does not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do o er a two-week window during which the audit will occur.
If any labor issues are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. This begins with creating a corrective action plan within 30 days. The vendor then comes under Company conservatorship to ensure there are no recurrences, which requires regular updates on the corrective measures taken, as well as photographic evidence.
IV. Risk Assessment- the Parts of Abercrombie's Business/Supply Chain Where There is a Risk of Slavery and/or Human Tra cking and the Steps we Take to Address Those Risks
Country Risks
The Company aims to not source from countries with known histories of forced labor or human tra cking. For example, the Company has a policy against using Uzbek cotton due to the government-sanctioned use of forced child labor during the harvesting process. We prohibit the use of cotton sourced from Uzbekistan and textiles produced using Uzbek cotton. We also take this several steps further to prohibit any materials sourcing from Uzbekistan (bar none), in protest of the country’s minor labor practices.

Further, the Company does not source con ict minerals. Con ict minerals are those mined or sourced in furtherance of armed con ict, speci cally from con ict areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”). Con ict minerals may include tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. To verify that the raw materials used in our product do not fuel con ict, we require suppliers to disclose the origin of the smelter of these minerals. As a member of the Con ict-Free Smelter Program, Abercrombie is aligned with other industry leaders on this important issue.
Even beyond these speci c cases, the Company uses a “trust but verify” approach with respect to its vendors, mills, and factories (described in detail above in How We Minimize Risk Using Internal and External Resources). Therefore, regardless of the country in which sourcing or manufacturing occurs, the Company’s partners and their downstream partners are held to an independent standard in labor practices which exceeds legal compliance.
Sector Risks
As a member of the apparel, personal care, and accessories sectors, Abercrombie has taken special care to monitor human rights risks associated with our product lifecycle. For our company and others in our sector(s), that risk is greatest at the international factory stage. We o set risks here by employing third-party auditors who are experts in our policies, local laws and regulations, country- speci c risks in the retail manufacturing sector, and warning signs of forced labor or human tra cking. As leading worldwide experts in the auditing eld, we trust our partners to e ectively reinforce our standards and relay to us any issues identi ed at the factory level.
Transaction Risks
Transactional risks at Abercrombie are distinct from vendor risks. Transactional risks are risks that originate from the infrastructural supports to the Company’s business operations. Although transactional risk in our industry is comparatively less than in other industries with higher transactional pro les (banking, for example), our contractual process requires every service provider to agree that all of their business dealings will be in alignment with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Service providers are explicitly prohibited from inducing any Abercrombie employee to violate the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and commit to same as part of their contractual arrangement with the Company. Finally, service providers are required to observe speci c and general labor and employment laws. These measures

ensure that our service providers support our Company commitment to social responsibility.
Business Partnership Risks
Vendors: before we begin production with any new factory, it must rst go through a rigorous Quality Assurance inspection to make sure its operations meet Company standards. A factory also must complete an initial social audit and commit to our Vendor Code of Conduct before the partnership can be approved. As described above, our Vendor Code of Conduct binds factories to speci c standards of operation, and requires vendors to address any signs of forced labor or human tra cking. During the life of the partnership, the factory not only receives audits as described above, but product is inspected for compliance with our regulatory and quality standards. If any factory should fail on any of these indicators and/or refuse to make improvements, the relationship could be terminated. Auditors: we only contract with third-party monitoring rms who employ true experts as auditors. We require that auditors be experts in the local laws of the country and possess local language skills. As a Company, we continually monitor auditor performance.
V. Measurement of E ectiveness Against Our Key Performance Indicators
For 2016-17, we have added a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of training all employees Company-wide on the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which includes training on social sustainability, forced labor, and human tra cking. In addition, we have already identi ed additions to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the next update that will improve communications and training related to this important issue.
In the next few years, we will leverage these e orts to begin realignment around a hybrid KPI for our Merchant and Sourcing teams that considers both economic cost and social impact. Improved documentation of product component sourcing, lifecycle, path of travel, and social and environmental impact will also be a long-term addition to our Company KPIs.
VI. Abercrombie's Training About Slavery and Human Tra cking
Abercrombie aims for every employee to be familiar with the Company’s commitment to social sustainability and opposition to forced labor and human tra cking. All Home O ce associates are trained on the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. Further training is administered to those who interact directly with our supply chain. All Home O ce or remote team members and managers directly

involved in Supply Chain Management are required to take a training course on human tra cking and slavery that discusses the risks of human tra cking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate those risks. Finally, in our Vendor Code of Conduct all of our vendors agree to take measures against involuntary (forced) labor and human tra cking. To ensure the e cacy of these promises, we make sure vendors are familiar with and aware of the di erent acts, means, and purposes of human tra cking. This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the Company's slavery and human tra cking statement for the
nancial year ending January 28, 2017.

MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING.
MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT
Shop Direct, the UK’s largest integrated pureplay digital retailer and financial services provider, is made up of Very.co.uk, Littlewoods.com, VeryExclusive.co.uk and LittlewoodsIreland.ie. Our websites receive an average of more than 1.4 million website visits every day, with 74% of online sales completed on mobile devices.
At Shop Direct, we are fully committed to taking action to combat modern slavery and human trafficking within our business and supply chains. Our modern slavery and human trafficking policy can be found here.
This is our third annual modern slavery statement, which outlines the steps we’ve taken during the 12 months up to and including 30 June 2018. It covers both Shop Direct Home Shopping Limited and Shop Direct Finance Company Limited – respectively the retail and financial services businesses within the Shop Direct Limited group of companies.
Our 2016/17 modern slavery statement for the 12-month period ending 30 June 2017 can be accessed here.
INTRODUCTION
At Shop Direct, we’re committed to behaving in a responsible way. We place a strong focus on maintaining strong ethical and environmental standards and being the best possible citizen we can in the communities in which we operate.
We continue to support the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and to abide by the ten principles in all of our business operations, and during the year have further developed our

relationships with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety, Sedex and Fast Forward.
These relationships, along with senior stakeholders who are tasked with driving and embedding our CSR agenda, help guide and support our CSR activities at Shop Direct. Our latest annual CSR report, which outlines our progress and plans, can be found here.
PROGRESS ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES
Our last modern slavery report outlined the steps we took during 2016/17 to reduce risk across our operations. Building on those actions, we made the following progress during our 2017/18 financial year to further enhance our approach to combating modern slavery and human trafficking.
At Shop Direct, we have a broad and varied supply chain, sourcing both own brand clothing and footwear and home and living products from over 700 factories in 30 countries worldwide. This includes key regions such as China, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Poland and Turkey. We are aware that our supply chain is complex and constantly evolving, so we work in collaboration with our suppliers to ensure visibility of sites manufacturing our product through the use of third party audits and the Sedex system. In order to maintain transparency, we continue to publish a full list of our manufacturing sites and are working to include factories and processing plants in the lower tiers.
Click here to view our latest list.
Our dedicated responsible sourcing teams, based both in the UK and key sourcing countries, continue to work hard to understand risks specific to our supply chain and the countries from which we source. They do this by utilising internal expertise and databases, as well as third party information including audits, ETI updates, trade union risk maps and NGO country reports.
From this work, we know that there is an increased risk of modern slavery where there is:
A prevalence of migrant labour Contract and agency workers High presence of refugees Young workers and risk of child labour Vulnerable workers Unauthorised subcontracting
Certain countries within our operations may

have one or more of these risks and this leads us to more closely monitor these areas. We do this through regular visits by our in-country teams, who offer additional support and guidance to our suppliers to ensure that they are managing these situations responsibly.
We continue to ensure that all suppliers of own brand products have signed up to our code of conduct prior to doing business with us. Our code is based on the International Labour Organisation’s labour standards and the provisions laid out in the ETI base code. We review and update the code of conduct regularly in line with changes in best practice and lessons learnt from ours and others’ experiences. We have recently launched a new supplier website, and are currently on-boarding all merchandise suppliers onto the site. An up-to-date copy of the codes of conduct are included on the new website for our suppliers to access.
Last year, we reported on a consistent issue we had found in Malaysia around workers paying fees to secure employment. Over the last 12 months, we have continued to work with these suppliers on issues relating to the employment of migrant workers. In April 2018, we hosted a responsible partnership workshop for the suppliers, focusing on issues of modern slavery and the Dhaka Principles on responsible recruitment. Since this workshop, we have spent time with suppliers to enable better understanding of the role of agents in the recruitment chain, looking at the contracts that they have in place with their agents and initiating conversations with those agents. This is helping to change practices and ensure new workers enter the workplace free of debt.
The issue around migrant recruitment fees remains complex and one that will be best tackled via a collaborative industry approach. With this in mind, we have joined the ETI’s responsible recruitment working group alongside other stakeholders, with the aim of sharing best practice examples, providing guidance for corporate policies and strategies in this area, and developing specific actions to mitigate, manage and remediate modern slavery risks amongst migrant workers. The group will look not only at responsible recruitment and what can be done in both sender and host countries to ensure workers enter employment free of debt, but will also include a wider set of labour rights issues facing migrant workers.
Alongside our audit programme, our strategy still focuses on better supporting our factories by offering our time and resources to assist them in

making sustainable improvements. Our incountry specialists work collaboratively with our internal teams and suppliers to resolve issues that are identified and deliver training to prevent issues occurring. Over the past 12 months, we have launched new projects with suppliers in both India and Bangladesh, as well as continuing our partnership with Impactt in China.
In our continued Chinese factory improvement programme, our factories are making good progress, particularly in terms of improved HR policies and processes. This should support our factories in better spotting the signs of modern slavery. The final module of this training will take place in January 2019 and will focus on social dialogue, empowering workers and management to better communicate potential slavery risks. As well as this, we have engaged in a pilot project in China to deliver online modern slavery training to HR professionals within factories.
In India, we recognise that there can still be challenges in the lower tiers of our supply chain, particularly around poor practice by labour agents when recruiting young female workers into spinning mills. To try and tackle these risks, we have launched a project in partnership with two other retailers and a local NGO in Tamil Nadu, which focusses on community engagement, work with the agents and engagement with the mills and workers. We are still in the early stages of this project but already are seeing increased understanding by workers’ families and wider communities of potential risks around forced labour and poor recruitment practices.
To further increase our commitment to finding and tackling modern slavery in our supply chains, both at home and abroad, we recently signed a revolutionary agreement with UK enforcement bodies, including the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and HMRC, to help eradicate modern slavery in the UK textiles industry. The Apparel and General Merchandise Public and Private Protocol commits signatories to work together to eradicate slavery and exploitation in textile supply chains. As a partner, we have pledged to raise awareness to prevent worker exploitation, protect vulnerable and exploited workers and disrupt exploitative practices within the industry.
When it comes to our non-merchandise supply base, we have considered and reviewed modern

slavery and human trafficking risks – where appropriate via individual audits and also through HR audits from relevant on-site partners, such as cleaning and catering suppliers. We also review our strategic nonmerchandise suppliers to confirm that their modern slavery statements adhere to our objectives and any new partners who come on board are also aligned.
Guidant Group, our biggest partner of agency workers, provides all temporary recruitment for our three fulfilment centres. Guidant ensures that all suppliers are vetted and audited as per their policy, with any accreditations checked. All on-site Guidant staff have completed a mandated modern slavery course and are trained on signs to monitor for within their colleague base.
Internally, we have continued to raise awareness of modern slavery across all business areas, through local communications and signposting colleagues to the modern slavery helpline should they suspect inappropriate activity internally or among our suppliers. We also ensure that we continually review, research, consult and conduct training needs analysis, to ensure we provide the right training to the right people, when needed. This year, we have included modern slavery as a topic in our broader regulatory training programme to ensure all colleagues have an understanding of our requirements.
OUR COMMITMENT – HOW WE’LL BUILD ON WHAT WE ARE DOING YEAR ON YEAR
We’re committed to continuous improvement to further enhance our approach to combatting modern slavery and human trafficking during our 2018/19 financial year.
Going forward, we will continue to work collaboratively with other retailers, trade unions, NGOs and membership organisations to tackle broader issues related to modern slavery. Over the next 12 months, we will look to develop KPIs relating to modern slavery, focussing on internal training and awareness campaigns, further developing our supply chain due diligence and supplier awareness of modern slavery risks, and the development of effective mitigation and remedy processes.
In 2018/19, we will continue to review current partners’ actions in line with modern slavery requirements. We will also continue to ensure that any new non-merchandise partners who come on board have modern slavery statements

that adhere to our objectives. In 2018/19, this will include a new logistics partner as well as those companies working on our new 850,000 square foot, state-of-the-art distribution and returns centre at the East Midlands Gateway development, which is scheduled to be fully operational in 2021.
We will continue to ensure we include modern slavery as a topic in our broader regulatory training programme and evaluate the need to produce relevant training and education modules on modern slavery and forced labour. This will also be supported by directing colleagues who work for our suppliers to the modern slavery helpline.
Over the next 12 months, we are also looking to revamp our CSR board to better align to both the CSR priorities of the business and our wider industry and relevant bodies. This will also support us in maintaining our commitment to combatting modern slavery and human trafficking in the year ahead and beyond.
This statement has been approved by senior stakeholders who are tasked with driving and embedding our CSR agenda and our group CEO, who will review and update it annually.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
CBRE’s multi-billion-dollar global supply chain is critical to our success. We expect all our suppliers to adhere to our Global Supplier Code of Conduct and to provide services in a responsible manner. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and are committed to consistently reviewing and strengthening our processes and systems to minimize the risk of human rights infringements anywhere in our supply chain. This statement has been written in accordance with the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015). The Act requires that businesses with a turnover of more than £36 million disclose information regarding their policies and actions over the financial year to eradicate modern

human slavery and trafficking from their operations and supply chain. This is CBRE Group’s second annual statement on slavery and human trafficking. Our first statement was published voluntarily ahead of the statutory commencement of the reporting requirement.

303,"3i Group plc - Slavery and human trafficking
statement made pursuant to section 54 of the
Modern Slavery Act 2015 for the financial year
ended 31 March 2018
3i Group plc
Slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended
31 March 2018 (""FY18"")
This statement is made by 3i Group plc (""3i"") pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015
(""MSA"") and applies to all 3i's subsidiaries (as defined in the UK Companies Act) whether
incorporated within or outside the UK.
This statement was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on 26 September 2018.
Overarching statement
3i is committed to achieving its investment objectives in a sustainable way by behaving responsibly
as an employer, as an investor and as an international corporate citizen. We take responsibility for
our actions, carefully consider how others will be affected by our choices and ensure that our values
and ethics are integrated into our formal business policies, practices and plans.
In particular, 3i is committed to ensuring that (i) there is no slavery or human trafficking in any part of
its business or supply chains and (ii) the companies in which it invests are similarly committed to
ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in any part of their businesses or supply chains.
Meaning of slavery and human trafficking
Our understanding of slavery and human trafficking is based on the definitions set out in the MSA
and is guided by the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the conventions of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) particularly relating to forced or compulsory labour. We
recognise that forced labour as a form of slavery includes debt bondage and the restriction of a
person's freedom of movement whether that be physical, non-physical or, for example, by the
withholding of a worker's identity papers.
3i's business
3i is an investment company with two complementary businesses, Private Equity and Infrastructure,
specialising in core investment markets in northern Europe and North America. As at 31 March
2018, 3i's total assets under management (""AUM"") were nearly £12.0 billion, just under 97% of
which consisted of investments in Europe and North America. The remaining c.3% of AUM related
primarily to legacy investments in Asia which are being managed for realisation over the next few
years.
Our Private Equity business invests in companies with an enterprise value of typically between
€100m and €500m at acquisition in its core investment markets of northern Europe and North
America. The Private Equity business has a small number of legacy investments in Asia.
Our Infrastructure business invests in economic infrastructure investments and both greenfield and
operational project investments in developed economies, principally in Europe, and with a North
American Infrastructure platform launched in March 2017. The Infrastructure business also acts as
investment manager of the 3i India Infrastructure Fund - a US$1.2 billion fund raised in 2008. No
new investments have been made by the 3i India Infrastructure Fund since 2012 when its investment
period ended. Further details of the Private Equity and Infrastructure portfolios are set out below in
the section headed ""3i's portfolio"".
We currently have operations in eight offices across Europe, North America and Asia. At 31 March
2018 3i had a total of 244 employees, of whom just under two-thirds were located in our head office
in London and with just eight employees located outside of Europe and North America.
The map below shows the geographical distribution of 3i's 244 employees as at 31 March
2018
New York 7%
Europe 90%
London 65%
Frankfurt 8%
Amsterdam 6%
Luxembourg 1%
""subsequently closed
We comply fully with applicable human rights legislation in the countries in which we operate, for
example covering areas such as freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, equal
remuneration and protection against discrimination. For all matters relating to human rights, we
comply with local laws, and if those laws provide lesser protection than UK law, we apply the
principles enshrined in UK law.
We have a comprehensive suite of corporate responsibility policies, copies of which are available on
our website, including our policies on People, Equal Opportunity & Diversity, Global Recruitment &
Selection and Health & Safety. All 3i staff globally have access to an independent and confidential
telephone service managed by Expolink which they can use to report any concerns. We are very
confident that there is no slavery or human trafficking taking place in 3i's business.
3i's governance structure
The Board is responsible for corporate responsibility, including issues such as slavery and human
trafficking. The Board and its committees review our approach and policies in this important area and
address specific issues if they arise. Day-to-day responsibility rests with executive management and,
in particular, the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive has also established a number of committees
to oversee and monitor policies and procedures and to address issues if they arise, including the
Executive Committee which he chairs.

packaging, pulp and paper. We transform renewable resources into
recyclable products that people depend on every day. IP Luxembourg
operates as a subsidiary of International Paper and holds subsidiary
operations throughout Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Africa and Brazil.
We are accountable to International Paper's Code of Conduct, policies and
practices and are unified around shared commitments to strengthen our
people and communities, provide solutions for our customers and ensure
the sustainability of our company, communities and planet. Around the
world, our products are primarily manufactured in our own facilities by full-
time, part-time and contract employees who work directly for our company.
All employees are required to follow the International Paper Code of
Conduct and company policies, including policies on human rights and
dignity. Furthermore, International Paper strongly encourages and provides
support for our joint venture and business partners to follow the same legal
and ethical principles and respect for human rights. International Paper is
an ongoing defender of respect and dignity and has had an official human
rights statement since 2012.
OUR POLICIES AND STANDARDS
Global principles. We respect international principles of human rights,
including those expressed in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the
United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,
the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and others. We believe our strong
respect for human rights has always been embodied in the values of The IP
Way, our corporate policies and our Code of Conduct. Such values
continue on in The IP Way Forward. We comply with the laws of every
country in which we operate and expect those with whom we do business
to do the same. We have longstanding high standards of ethical business
conduct that are at the core of how we operate.
A public stand. Since 2012, International Paper has publically declared
our Human Rights Statement and published our California Transparency
Act declaration statement and Supplier Code of Conduct (""Supplier Code"").
The Supplier Code makes clear to our suppliers our expectations of them
to have responsible, legal and ethical behavior within our supply chains and
to abide by all laws on human trafficking, forced labor and child labor. Our
procurement contracts and purchase order terms and conditions require
contractual commitment from our suppliers to abide by the principles of our
Supplier Code, and we have enhanced our procurement procedures to
assess non-compliance risks and monitor our supply chain. This year, we
are adding to our corporate policies a standalone human rights policy. All of
these documents make our commitments more public and ensure our
stakeholders know the standards we apply to ourselves and expect from all
of our business partners.
UK compliance. The UK Modern Slavery Act (the ""Act"") requires
commercial organizations in any sector that have a total turnover of above
£36 million, and that supply goods or services with at least part of their
business in the United Kingdom, to produce a slavery and human
trafficking statement for each financial year. The Act requires such
businesses to produce a statement setting out steps they take during the
financial year to ensure slavery and human trafficking are not in any of their
supply chains or any part of their own business. As a parent corporation to
subsidiaries which reach this threshold, IP Luxembourg submits this
statement on behalf of International Paper and its subsidiaries worldwide.
Employee requirements. Everyone who is part of the International Paper
business community, whether an employee, contractor, agent or supplier,
will be held accountable to conduct business with or for us in an ethical
manner. Our employees are, under the terms of their employment, required
to follow all laws of the countries in which they operate, along with our
Code of Conduct and all International Paper policies and procedures,
employee manuals, various business rules and standard operating
procedures. Employees who violate laws or company policies are subject
to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
Supplier requirements. Enterprise-wide, we are supported by over
100,000 suppliers globally. We expect them to comply with our Supplier
Code and all applicable laws, including those laws and principles
prohibiting involvement with human trafficking and slavery. If they fail to
comply with the law or do not address contractual non-compliance in a
timely manner, International Paper reserves its contractual rights to

306,"Burton's Biscuit Company (a trading name of Burtons Foods Limited) (""Burton's"") Slavery and
Human Trafficking Statement for the Financial Year 2016
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out
the steps the Company has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in
our supply chains or in any part of our business.
We employ over 2,000 people around the UK, in three main manufacturing facilities in Llantarnam,
Edinburgh and Blackpool, a chocolate refinery in Moreton and a central distribution hub in
Liverpool. Our head office is based in St. Albans and a subsidiary office is located in Blackpool. We
also engage temporary labour at sites, via labour agencies and we outsource certain services to third
party providers.
Burton's take its responsibility for the lives of those employed by it and the environment in which it
operates seriously. With this in mind, Burton's Biscuit Company commits to ensuring it complies with
the Human Rights Act, and pays due regard to environmental impacts and ethical business practices.
As a company, we use the standard of the ETI code (the Ethical Trading Initiative code) as our
minimum standard.
Burton's Biscuit Company forbids the use of child labour and our Social Compliance Policy states
clearly that no person shall be employed at any age younger than the legal minimum age for working
in the jurisdiction in which the work is being conducted. Where certain workplace conditions apply
such as night shift work, working with dangerous machinery and/or hazardous substances, no
person under the age of 18 will be employed.
New joiners as part of their induction are introduced to the ETI code and the standards contained
within it which include the following:
Employment is freely chosen;
Child labour shall not be used;
Living wages are paid;
Working hours are not excessive; and
No discrimination is practised.
Our HR team carry out regular self-assessment audits for each site, to make certain the code is
followed and checks are undertaken of employee's addresses to highlight any instances where there
are multiple employees at the same address that require investigating. Any concerns are then
addressed with appropriate steps taken to resolve the issue. Also at site level where we employ
agency staff, we use only licenced and approved agencies that are contractually bound to comply
with applicable legislation and standards. These agencies are subject to audits to ensure they meet
BRC global standards (a manufacturing certification programme) and retailer codes of practice.
Burton's also has a clear Business Protection and Whistle-blower policy as well as a Business
Protection Helpline where employees are encouraged to report any concerns regarding internal
practices. Burton's factory sites are also subject to independent audits at a frequency based on risk.
As a biscuit manufacturer, we have a large number of suppliers of ingredients, packaging and
services. To ensure best practice throughout our supply chain, we have a comprehensive supplier
and material approval review procedure. All suppliers go through this process and we include an
ethical questionnaire as part of our initial assessment, of all supply sites. Our trading terms also
require suppliers to perform services in accordance with ethical trading initiatives and industry
standards.
Burton's is a member of Sedex (the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange), a not-for-profit membership
organisation dedicated to driving improvements in responsible social and ethical business practices
in global supply chains. Sedex works as a collaborative platform for sharing ethical supply chain data
and enables members to share and report on information in key areas such as labour standards and
business ethics. As members of Sedex, we actively monitor the ethical standards to which we, and
our suppliers, adhere to and it is the preferred method for ongoing assessment of our supply base.
Approximately 95% of our supply base is Sedex registered, with remaining suppliers asked to
complete an ethical questionnaire annually. Burton's supplier audits include ethical standards, at a
frequency based on risk, and we also audit the information our suppliers have on Sedex. Where a
supplier shows any high risk score, this will trigger an audit and appropriate steps will then be taken
to address the issue.
Burton's has long recognised the benefits of using ethically and sustainably sourced raw materials.
Wherever possible, we actively look to source locally produced ingredients for our products. This not
only helps support the local economies in which we operate, but also gives us additional reassurance
over the provenance and quality of our ingredients. Burton's purchases all of its bulk palm oil from
sustainable, segregated sources. We have supported the drive towards palm oil sustainability since
2006, when we became a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and we were
also one of the first companies to purchase the initial RSPO certified segregated palm oil in the UK.
We also only source cocoa based products from suppliers that are members of the ICI (International
Cocoa Initiative) or the WCF (World Cocoa Foundation). The ICI supports schemes and organisations
that are working to eradicate child labour in the cocoa sector and the WCF funds work to ensure the
sustainability of the cocoa industry through programmes such as The Sustainable Tree Corps
Program and also helps improve the livelihood of cocoa farmers.
The Board carries out a strategic risk assessment of the company quarterly and looks at processes in
place and actions required to reduce all strategic risks where economically possible. The Sedex
system allows us to monitor and be alerted to any high risk areas and together with our own due
diligence processes we are prepared to address any issues if and when they arise and take the
appropriate steps. We pay particular attention on both the manufacturing workforce and the supply
chain as these are the highest risk areas in the business.
Burton's is committed to ensuring that incidences of child labour, labour exploitation, modern
slavery and human trafficking do not form part of our business and supply chain. We are confident
that the policies and procedures we have in place and the standard we require of our suppliers will
allow us to attain this goal.

OUR INVOLVEMENT FOR A SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT
Statement on Modern Slavery and Preventing Labor Exploitation
The SPH welcomes the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the duty it places on businesses to disclose publicly the steps being taken to tackle forced labor and human trafficking in addition to ensuring it is not taking place in our supply chains or in any other part of our business. We expect the same commitment from our contractors, suppliers and other business partners. Our full policy on Preventing Labour Exploitation can be seen here. As part of our due diligence in our partnership with suppliers and recruitment agencies, we will conduct audits to ensure compliance and also include specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labor, or anyone held in slavery or servitude. We want our customers to be confident that both we and our suppliers share the same standards and have the commitment to treat all employees and workers fairly, with respect for human rights and to ensure they are not in any way forced to work under modern slavery conditions. Businesses must play its part. However, tackling modern slavery effectively requires increased awareness and collaboration between businesses and statutory agencies. Together we can work together in order to make a difference in upholding human rights. This Policy Statement has been approved on behalf of the management team and relates to activities during the financial year ending 30th November 2018. This will be reviewed and published annually.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING

FINANCIAL YEAR 2018

This statement is published by Hilton in compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. It details the steps taken by Hilton to aid in the prevention of modern slavery and human trafficking in any part of its business and supply chains across its global operations during the Financial Year 2018. Hilton manages, leases and franchises hotels, provides hospitality services, and carries on business in the United Kingdom largely through Hilton Worldwide Manage Limited and Hilton Worldwide Limited, as well as Adda Hotels, HLT Stakis Operator Limited, Hilton Worldwide Holding LLP, Hilton International IP Holding Limited and Hilton International Hotels (UK) Limited. For the purposes of this statement, the companies carrying on business within the United Kingdom, including the entities mentioned above, are collectively referred to as “Hilton”.

OUR COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS
At Hilton, we have a shared purpose to be the most hospitable company in the world by positively impacting our guests, Team Members*, hotel owners and communities. As a business of people serving people, respecting human rights is a core part of our mission.

OUR BUSINESS STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY CHAIN
Hilton is a leading global hospitality company, with a portfolio of 17 world-class brands comprising more than 5,600 properties with over 913,000 rooms in 113 countries and territories, supported by over 405,000 Team Members*.
Under management agreements, we use our marks and systems to operate hotels. The 169,000 people employed at our managed properties, leased hotels, and our corporate offices (including Hilton Supply Management – “HSM”) are referred to as “Hilton Employees”.
Through franchise agreements, we license our marks and systems, which help the franchisee succeed in its business. Franchised properties make independent decisions regarding their hotel operations, including procurement, employment and training practices. The people who are employed by the owners (or its designees) of franchised properties are referred to as “Franchise

Employees”. There are approximately 236,000 Franchise Employees who work on-property at independently owned and operated franchise properties in the Hilton portfolio.
HSM is the global procurement and supply chain arm of Hilton. HSM supports over 7,000 hotels across the world, approximately 10% of which are Hilton-leased or managed properties, 62% are franchises and 28% are independent businesses unaffiliated with Hilton. HSM develops and negotiates product and service supply programs with over 2,000 suppliers that make available goods and services at the best combination of price, quality, and service. While we strongly encourage our hotel owners across our global portfolio to use HSM services, not all hotel owners choose to participate. In addition, hotel owners are responsible for establishing their own supply chain during the development stage of hotels, including construction.
A more detailed description of our business model can be found in our public filings.

OUR POLICIES AND GOVERNANCE
Our commitment to respecting human rights is enshrined in our Code of Conduct, Human Rights Principles, and Responsible Sourcing Policy, including the prohibition of forced labour, bonded labour, child labour, slave labour, human trafficking and recruitment fees, and the prohibition for any Hilton property, product, or service from being used in any manner that supports or enables any form of abuse and exploitation. Those three documents apply only to Hilton Employees at our leased and managed hotels, and our corporate offices. However, we make them available to our franchisees and our business partners to educate them on Hilton’s business principles and to encourage them to develop similar policies and procedures for their own operations, and share those policies and procedures with their respective business partners.
Human Rights is managed by Hilton’s Corporate Responsibility team, in collaboration with the Legal Compliance Department. Hilton’s Human Rights strategy is reviewed by an internal working group, which brings together representatives of key support functions, and is approved by the Executive Committee representatives for Corporate Affairs and Legal.
In May 2018, we launched our 2030 Travel with Purpose Goals to cut our environmental footprint in half and double our investment in social impact, in support of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Goals include commitments to implement human rights due diligence across our global operations, to work with suppliers to eradicate any form of forced labor and human trafficking, and to create and partner with cross-industry networks to advance international human rights.
OUR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES
In our operations, all Team Members are empowered to identify signs of human trafficking through training and risk-identification guidance (see relevant sections below). We encourage Hilton Employees to raise concerns about potential violations of our Code of Conduct, including risks of human trafficking or modern slavery, via the Hilton Hotline, an anonymous reporting mechanism for anyone to report concerns regarding our corporate

offices, leased and managed properties.
In our supply chain, our Responsible Sourcing Policy outlines the standards expected of Hilton suppliers. Suppliers are encouraged to have appropriate management systems in place and take steps to comply with this policy. Based upon amount of spend and regional risk, we require our top suppliers to acknowledge our Responsible Sourcing Policy.
In 2018, we enhanced our human rights due diligence activities by embedding human rights in our new country due diligence process. The process includes a holistic review of human rights risks relevant to our industry and appropriate risk mitigation plans which apply to Hilton hotels in that country regardless of brand or ownership structure. The new country due diligence process is overseen by our Legal Compliance Department and includes review by the Executive Compliance Committee, made of representatives from the Executive Committee. At the individual project level, we carry out due diligence review on our hotel owners, including a human rights reputation review and the transmission of our Code of Conduct and Human Rights Principles to all potential owners. We continue to develop tools to increase hotel owners’ awareness of the modern slavery risks associated with hotel development, operations and supply chains.
OUR RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT
In 2015, we completed a global human rights impact assessment across our business activities. This assessment focused on the risk that our business operations may pose to individuals’ rights in terms of severity and likelihood, based on external research and experience. Our assessment identified labour rights, trafficking and modern slavery, privacy rights and land rights as areas of focus.
That same year, we also conducted a mapping exercise of our global supply chain across a range of economic, environmental and social risks, including human rights, based on external indicators and spend. This exercise highlighted categories such as services, produce, seafood, and apparel for additional attention.

In order to keep our risk identification up-to-date, we map all of our operating hotels and pipeline countries against eleven external human rights risk indices in both operations and supply chain, each updated annually. For example, the Modern Slavery Index assesses the risk to business in any industry of the possible association with or exposure to practices of slavery, servitude, trafficking in persons and forced labour by state and non-state actors within its supply chain, as defined by VeriskMaplecroft. Based on this analysis, we believe that fewer than 9% of hotels are located in countries with higher risks of modern slavery in the supply chain. The Global Intelligence team utilizes a social media-monitoring platform that identifies possible human trafficking based on keyword scraping. Any suspicious content is escalated to the relevant regional Safety and Security director.
We supplement these mapping exercises based on indices with internal data collected via our internal Global Enterprise Risk Survey, which is distributed internally to over 250 Hilton leaders, and includes human rights and modern slavery issues. As part of our new country development due diligence process, we developed human rights risk briefs and mitigation plans. Each mitigation plan will be integrated in individual future hotel projects as appropriate.
This dynamic risk identification and continuous monitoring process helps inform our human rights strategy, and the prioritization of countries and issues for more detailed risk assessment, due diligence and training across operations, supply chain, and the development phase of our hotels.
Based on our risk assessment, we prioritized analysing our leased and managed hotels in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) with respect to human rights risks in labour outsourcing. We updated our standard form of contracts with vendors to require compliance with our Responsible Sourcing Policy and the undertaking of an ethical trading audit through a third-party certified auditor, following the SMETA protocol. We also created training and resources for our hotels and labour providers on the risk of modern slavery in labour sourcing. We rolled out the training and started the auditing program in 2018.
At a hotel level, a list of signs to identify risks of human trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labour is posted in employee areas at all our

managed hotels globally. In the U.S., we also rolled out posters to raise awareness of the U.S. National Anti-Trafficking Hotline in guest-facing areas in our managed hotels in line with a number of state laws, and shared available resources with franchise hotels.
TRAINING AND AWARENESS
As signatory of the ECPAT Code of Conduct to combat child sexual exploitation in the travel industry since 2011, we have been providing training on risks of human trafficking for sexual exploitation to all our hotels. In 2018, we rolled out our new mandatory training requirement for all hotels globally as part of our required Brand Training. Our updated annual Code of Conduct training, now including a section on human rights, has been rolled out as a mandatory training to all Hilton Employees. Across both trainings, we trained 1,803 General Managers (68%) by the end of 2018. Another 53,700 Team Members across 5,070 hotels have taken the online training. Our Safety and Security teams and outside partners routinely train hotel Team Members on identifying and combatting human trafficking.
In 2018, we rolled out our e-Learning training on the key risks of modern slavery in labour sourcing. The training module is available to all Team Members and mandatory for all Hilton Employees in EMEA who are key decision-makers in recruitment and outsourcing decisions (General Managers, Human Resources, Procurement, Finance). By the end of 2018, 84% of the assigned Team Members had taken the training. We developed guidance documents that provide additional help to hotels and agencies conducting due diligence in labour sourcing. Those documents are available to all hotels, including franchises.
On International Human Rights Day on December 10, 2018, Hilton announced it would share its internal training on the risks of modern slavery in labour sourcing with the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) to accelerate the industry’s ability to identify and mitigate those risks, in line with the ITP Forced Labour Principles (see section below).
All of our Hilton HSM Employees have taken our e-Learning course on Responsible Sourcing, which includes a section on risks of modern slavery in the supply chain.

PARTNERSHIPS AND ENGAGEMENT
Human rights risks in the travel and tourism industry are complex and we recognise that we cannot solve them on our own. Accordingly, we are proactively engaging with industry and expert organisations to better identify challenges, develop solutions and accelerate impact.
We have been signatories of the ECPAT Code of Conduct since 2011 to fight the sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism, and have been providing their training on identifying signs of trafficking to all our hotels.
Our President and CEO, Chris Nassetta, is the Chair of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). In 2018, we supported the launch of the ECPAT/WTTC Call for Action for the Protection of Children in Travel and Tourism.
We are co-founders of the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) and an active member of their Human Rights working group. Building on the launch of the ITP Human Rights Policy Statement and Human Rights Goals in 2017, we supported the development and launch of the ITP Forced Labour Principles, which were modelled off the Consumer Goods Forum Priority Industry Principles to ensure consistency and scale of impact with the hotel industry’s key business partners. To accelerate the industry’s ability to identify risks of modern slavery and implement the Forced Labour Principles in practice, we announced on International Human Rights Day on December 10, 2018 that we would

share our internal training on risks of modern slavery in labour sourcing with the ITP. It will be available online in 2019.
In November 2016, we were co-founders of the UK Stop Slavery Hotel Industry Network led by Shiva Foundation, which brings together hotel brands, operators and owners. We supported the draft and launch of the Framework to Engage with Suppliers, which provides tools to help procurement teams engage with suppliers to address risks of forced labour and modern slavery in the supply chain. We also supported the Network’s new Resource Hub. Both resources are a first for the hotel industry.
We are members and sit on the Steering Committee of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights, a coalition that works to advance human rights in a business context through crossindustry peer learning, outreach and capacity building, and by informing policy.
In order to better combat risks of trafficking for sexual exploitation, we have partnered with Vital Voices since 2012. In 2013, we co-founded the Global Freedom Exchange (GFE) programme to support women leaders at the forefront of global efforts to prevent and respond to human trafficking. Since its launch, we have helped empower 127 antitrafficking women advocates from 50 countries. Some of the GFE Fellows went on to be recognized as Trafficking in Persons Heroes by the U.S. State Department, like Boom Mosby in 2017 and Francisca Awah Mbuli in 2018.

OUR ONGOING COMMITMENT
Our commitment to human rights issues, including addressing slavery and human trafficking, is central to who we are as a business of people serving people around the world for 100 years. As we celebrate our 100th anniversary in 2019, we are proud of our mission to strengthen the communities in which we operate and look forward to continuing to innovate, implement and build on our human rights strategy, continuing to strengthen the awareness of our Team Members, and advancing industry collaboration to drive positive impact at scale across our value chain.

310,"Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
June 2017
Grosvenor Group is committed to doing business in a responsible way, and through our activities, to earning a reputation for quality, integrity and social responsibility.
Aligned with this objective is our wholehearted and active support for the aims of the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Our commitment is to ensure that slavery, human trafficking, child labour – indeed, any abuse of human rights – have no place in or around our organisation. We recognise the importance of the role we can play in preventing such abuses within our spheres of influence, to create a culture of awareness and transparency and actively engage in the eradication of modern day slavery.
In publishing this annual statement*, we are pleased to outline the steps that Grosvenor Group Ltd (the “Group”) has taken to meet these objectives.
About Grosvenor
Grosvenor is one of the world's largest privately owned property businesses. We create, manage and invest in properties and places in more than 60 cities around the world, applying rigorous financial discipline to achieve commercial success. But we do so with the aim of making a lasting contribution, today and for future generations, to the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of the urban communities we are part of and on which our own success depends. It’s what we call our ‘Living cities’ philosophy, which guides our activities to help foster thriving places which reflect the spirit of individual cities, ultimately contributing to their enduring success.
Organisational structure and supply chains
Our Group consists of four regional Operating Companies and an Indirect Investment portfolio managed by the holding company.
Direct investment: Grosvenor Britain & Ireland, Grosvenor Americas, Grosvenor Asia Pacific and Grosvenor Europe operate in a devolved structure model, each being responsible for its own property strategy founded on local experience and assessment of market opportunities.
Indirect investment: Our Indirect Investment business is tasked with further diversifying Grosvenor’s property-related interests beyond the expertise and strategies of our four regional Operating Companies.
As at 31 December 2016, Grosvenor employed 565 real estate and other professionals. For more information about us, our business and our structure, click here.

Supply chains: Our supply chains relate to our global real estate and professional service business and encompass personnel, goods and services to support our property business. We source a wide range of goods and services, and our suppliers cover an extensive range of manufacturers, construction companies, material suppliers and professional service providers.
Organisational policies
Upholding a reputation for quality, integrity and social responsibility is one of the Group’s three strategic objectives. Running a business which aims to live up to the highest ethical standards and with integrity is at the heart of the Grosvenor Group Compact which acts as a constitution between the Group and its shareholders.
Grosvenor has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. We oppose all forms of slavery and human trafficking, and are committed to taking steps to ensure that these do not occur in our business or our supply chains.
Our modern slavery policy forms part of a series of policies which reflect our commitment to responsible, sustainable and ethical business. These include but are not limited to:
 Employment and labour practices and policies that include matters relating to diversity and equal opportunities
 Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) and Sanctions  Gifts, Hospitality and Anti-Bribery  Codes of conduct  Tax policy
Due diligence and risk assessment
Through a cross-functional working group, we have commenced a process of reviewing our business and supply chains to identify and assess the risk of slavery and human trafficking as well as the measures already in place to address such risks, and any additional measures that may be warranted in light of the review.
While cognisant and vigilant that we could be at risk of slavery or human trafficking within our own business, we believe that there is a greater risk of slavery or human trafficking occurring within our supply chains (including suppliers of personnel, goods and services) particularly where we are involved, directly or indirectly, in the development, construction and ownership of property.
We acknowledge that slavery and human trafficking exist in many jurisdictions in which we operate, and/or from which we procure goods or services, and accordingly we are developing and implementing measures to identify and address any relevant issues that may arise.
Specifically, we are developing an approach to due diligence which extends to both our business and our supply chains, including an assessment of our global supply arrangements. For example in 2016, we have:

 updated our UK supplier questionnaire to include questions to help us understand a potential supplier’s commitment to ensuring that no modern slavery is taking place in its business and own supply chains; and
 developed a process with the aim of ensuring that appropriate contractual provisions are incorporated into new supplier contracts, leases, joint venture agreements and other commercial agreements and renewals of such existing contracts, which require a supplier to take steps to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in its business or in its supply chains, and enable us to obtain information to confirm the foregoing.
Training
We are rolling out measures designed to ensure that Grosvenor staff are trained to identify possible incidences of slavery and human trafficking, and to understand the implications of the Modern Slavery Act for our organisation. For example, we are developing a mandatory online training programme for all our staff, covering the topic of modern slavery, the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act and its implications for the Grosvenor business. We are also working on the development of specific training programmes for groups of our staff, such as the teams involved in procurement and human resources, in relation to the issues relevant to their areas of expertise.
Plans to strengthen our approach in future
In 2017 and beyond, within the Group, we intend to strengthen our due diligence processes, develop a risk assessment toolkit, build capacity by rolling out guidance and practical case studies on modern slavery to leadership teams and other employees on the ground, and engage with relevant global and local stakeholders to inform risk. Furthermore, within our supply chains, we intend to implement a supplier code of conduct, and increase the level of engagement and support provided to procurement teams to help them understand modern slavery issues and their role in identifying risks within Grosvenor’s supply chains.

311,"Ocado Modern Slavery Statement 2015/2016
Introduction Modern Slavery means offences of servitude, slavery, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking. We do not tolerate these activities in any part of our own business or our supply chain. This statement sets out the steps taken by Ocado Group plc and other relevant group companies during the 52 weeks ended 27 November 2016 to minimise risks associated with Modern Slavery.
Our business and supply chains Ocado is the world's largest dedicated online grocery retailer, operating its retail businesses in the United Kingdom, under the brand names Ocado, Fetch, Sizzle and Fabled; selling groceries, own brand food and general merchandise, sourced from over 50 countries. We have a long-standing sourcing agreement with Waitrose enabling us to sell Waitrose branded products. We commercialise our intellectual property primarily under an agreement to operate the online business of Morrisons. Our wider business operations also have complex supply chains, the majority of which are in respect of goods that are not for resale, including construction, maintenance and IT equipment used in our Customer Fulfilment Centres (CFC), regional distribution centres and offices. Furthermore, we have numerous service providers that keep our business operating day to day. Ocado has about 12,000 employees, with operations in the UK and offices in Poland, Spain and Bulgaria.
Our policies The Ocado Citizenship Code applies to everyone in our business. It outlines our commitment to comply with all relevant laws wherever we operate and to maintain the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, ethics and respect for human rights. Our Human Rights Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking from taking place in our supply chains. Our purchasing teams operate under guidance and standards of our Responsible Sourcing Code. This code applies to the supplier, manufacturer or any other person involved in supplying goods to Ocado. It contains a minimum set of standards expected of our suppliers, including the requirement of working conditions being safe and hygienic, employment being freely chosen and prohibiting the use of child labour. The code is based on International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and recommendations. It is designed to be fair, achievable, easy to check, and to promote the ongoing development of our suppliers. All employees are expected to report any concerns about Modern Slavery in accordance with our Whistleblowing Policy, which is readily accessible on our internal website and in our employee handbook. Through this policy any allegations will be dealt with in a formal and confidential manner. This is reinforced by our Anti-bribery Policy.
If you have any questions, please contact us at theocadoway@ocado.com

Ocado Modern Slavery Statement 2015/2016
Our due diligence process Our standard terms and conditions of purchase require our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and our Responsible Sourcing Code. Going forward, we plan to include additional specific responsible sourcing obligations in our contracts with our suppliers. We have a sourcing relationship with Waitrose for supply of grocery goods for resale, and in connection with these goods, Waitrose manages these supplier relationships in accordance with its Responsible Sourcing Strategy “The Waitrose Way”. We have been a member of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) since 2008 and use it as part of our supplier management system. We require that all of our own brand suppliers are also members of SEDEX, with a completed SEDEX Members Ethical Trading Audit (SMETA) or equivalent audit no older than three years, for both primary and secondary tiers. The information we gain through this system allows us to identify key areas in our supply chain that pose the highest risk, which we can then address accordingly. In addition, we keep and maintain a supplier tracking system in-house which we use to compare and closely manage all the information we collate. To ensure that both new and existing own brand suppliers comply with our values, we have in place a supply chain compliance programme consisting of the following steps: 1. New suppliers are required to complete ethical trade requirements and supply
chain questionnaires. 2. We carry out a technical audit which includes ethical requirements.
Any non-conformances will be validated by a corrective action plan (CAP) and risk assessed before proceeding any further. 3. Once steps one and two are approved, each supplier is added to Ocado’s internal supplier tracking database and links its supply chain to Ocado through SEDEX, where a third party SMETA or ethical audit is uploaded within 90 days. We review and monitor suppliers’ reports on SEDEX for any non-compliances. Where appropriate we require the supplier to implement a CAP followed by a third party audit. 4. We check CAP compliance for remediation or as a last resort terminate contracts with suppliers who continually fail to implement CAP. This programme enables us to assess and minimise risks associated with Modern Slavery in our supply chain based on country and industry sector. Furthermore, where appropriate, we will work with our suppliers to address concerns and improve standards.
Training We deliver due-diligence training to relevant teams of employees who deal with setting up suppliers in our systems. In 2016, we developed a plan to improve our training programme, in order to raise awareness of the Modern Slavery Act and to broaden knowledge of human rights in our business and supply chains.
If you have any questions, please contact us at theocadoway@ocado.com

Ocado Modern Slavery Statement 2015/2016
Our key areas of risk We believe we have greater level of responsibility for our own brand grocery goods, and are particularly vigilant with suppliers of these products. As a company sourcing products both within the United Kingdom and international markets, we are aware of the salient issues that affect our supply chains. The following industry sectors have been identified by ethical trade organisations to presenting high risks associated with Modern Slavery and are therefore our primary areas of concern: seasonal agricultural produce; poultry industry; fishing industry; and garment industry. We recently expanded our range of own brand products into the clothing market which opened us to new frontiers of responsibility. We recognise the sensitivity of labour issues in key garment producing countries and aim to continuously support improved standards through our due-diligence and contracting processes.
Our effectiveness in tackling modern slavery We use the following key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure how effective we have been in reducing the risk of Modern Slavery from taking place in any part of our business or supply chains: (1) the percentage of own brand suppliers on SEDEX; and (2) the percentage of own brand suppliers with a completed and compliant ethical audit.
Our next steps Our plan for future steps includes: • We will continue to improve our auditing standards across key risk areas in our supply
chain and business, including areas of our supply chain concerning non-food and not-for-resale goods. • We will implement improved supplier due-diligence and contracting processes across key risk areas of our business and supply chain. • We will work towards extending SEDEX membership to more of our supply chain beyond own brand. • We will introduce further KPIs in key risk areas of our supply chain and business. • We will roll out a more extensive training program across the wider areas of our business and supply chain in order to to raise awareness of the Modern Slavery Act and to raise broader knowledge of human rights.

To that end, this Group Statement (“Statement”), made pursuant to section 54 of the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015, outlines the steps we are taking across JPMorgan Chase to mitigate the potential risk of modern slavery occurring in our business and supply chain.

Morgan and Chase brands. We have a presence in more than 100 markets, including the U.K., and have over 256,000 employees worldwide.
III. Our Efforts on Human Rights and Modern Slavery Our firm’s respect for the protection and preservation of human rights is guided by the principles set forth in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Further, we acknowledge the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (“Guiding Principles”) as the recognized framework for corporations to respect human rights in their own operations and through business relationships.

A. Employees As a global financial services firm, we have a broad base of employees who work across various business lines, regions and functions to deliver products and services to our clients and customers, as well as employees who provide expertise in risk management, technology, legal, policy and regulation, finance, accounting, controls, human resources and many more areas.

Fostering diversity and inclusion is a cornerstone of our corporate culture, and we strive to ensure that employees are able to work in a safe, professional work environment.

We are committed to providing competitive and equitable compensation for our employees, and benefits that support our employees’ needs, such as health and retirement benefits and other programs to support work-life balance.
B. Suppliers JPMorgan Chase is committed to holding ourselves and our supplier community to high standards of business conduct and integrity. Our Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”) sets out our principles and expectations for suppliers, vendors, consultants, contractors and other third parties working on behalf of the firm, as well as the owners, officers, directors, employees, contractors and sub-contractors of these supplier organizations and entities. The Supplier Code communicates the responsibilities of suppliers on a range of issues, including the need to promote and respect human rights by working to prevent child and/or forced labor and human trafficking in their operations and supply chains, and by instituting practices and operations that are consistent with the framework provided by the Guiding Principles. This also includes an obligation to report any concern or suspected violation of the law or regulation related to JPMorgan Chase’s business or a violation of the Supplier Code.
C. Products and Services As part of our broad effort to integrate respect for human rights into the business of the firm, JPMorgan Chase has various policies and procedures designed to prevent our products and services from being used for improper purposes.

• Our Environmental and Social Policy Framework (“E&S Framework”) outlines the firm’s approach to assessing environmental and social risks, including those related to human rights, for transactions and clients. The E&S Framework covers certain prohibited activities, including those where there is evidence of child labor or modern slavery, such as forced labor and human trafficking. The firm believes that the consideration of human rights
2

issues is fundamental to sound risk management and a core part of corporate responsibility.

MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT 2017

02

AS A VALUES DRIVEN COMPANY, SOUTH32 IS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
South32’s purpose is to make a difference by developing natural resources, improving people’s lives now and for generations to come. We are trusted by our owners and partners to realise the potential of their resources. To maintain this trust, we recognise the need to operate with care for all stakeholders, including through our supply chain.
This document responds to the Section 54 requirements of the United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery Act 2015 (Act) where we describe the steps taken by South32 in FY17 to address potential modern slavery risks in our supply chain.1
‘Freedom from slavery’ is one of the 30 basic rights and freedoms that the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights defines as applying to everyone. Modern slavery refers to situations where one person takes away another person’s freedom so that they can be exploited. This includes their freedom to control their own body and to choose to refuse certain work or to stop working. In this statement, we use the Act’s definition of ‘modern slavery’ which is an umbrella term, encompassing the offences of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour, and human trafficking.
South32 has embarked on the journey of addressing modern slavery risks by emphasising collaboration and relationships, in addition to completing due diligence of our supply chain. By acting together, organisations and individuals can collectively diminish the demand for goods and services made using slavery.
It will take the combined effort of clear legislation, steps to address risks and resolve issues by organisations globally, working constructively with perpetrators of slavery (within reason) and the empowerment and support of victims to fully combat modern slavery.
“ With an estimated 45.8 million women, men and children living in modern slavery today, it is difficult to determine if any supply chain is slavery free.”2

SOUTH32 POLICIES
OUR POLICIES ARE AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP IN MANAGING MODERN SLAVERY RISKS AND RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS

05

Our approach to addressing modern slavery is an integrated component of our overall approach to human rights and business conduct.
We have company-wide policies in place to manage the risk of human rights abuses, including modern slavery and human trafficking, within our own operations and in those of our suppliers and business partners.
CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT
Our Code of Business Conduct (Code) demonstrates how we practically apply our values of Care, Trust, Togetherness and Excellence. The Code explains the principles and intent behind many of our standards and procedures applicable company-wide. All employees, Directors, officers, contractors and suppliers (where under relevant contractual obligation) and controlled entities must adhere to the Code, regardless of location or role. We also state our expectation that non-controlled joint ventures and minority interests adopt similar principles and standards. Our Code includes behavioural guidance and expectations for all of our stakeholders to respect human rights.

SUPPLY STANDARD
Our supply contracts and onboarding documentation require counterparties to adhere to our Code, our Sustainability Policy and our Sustainability and Business Conduct Requirements.
Our internal supply standard provides internal governance related to the contracting of goods and/ or services from external parties. The standard outlines how we approach our sourcing strategy, tender management and preparation, as well as supplier engagement and evaluation, contract authorisation, execution and implementation, and contract monitoring. In each of these critical interaction points with suppliers, our standard stipulates our commitment to do business with suppliers who are working to ensure respect for human rights and modern slavery. This includes our expectations of suppliers, outlined in our Sustainability and Business Conduct Requirements, which can be found on our website at www.south32.net. These requirements include no tolerance for child labour, forced labour or compulsory labour as well as provide support for freedom of association, a living wage and non-discrimination.

SUSTAINABILITY POLICY
South32’s Sustainability Policy defines the social, environmental and economic principles behind our decision making. Our Sustainability Policy details our commitment to respecting internationally recognised human rights. This policy has been developed to align to the International Council on Mining and Metals’ (ICMM) Sustainable Development Framework, the United Nations (UN) Global Compact Principles, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the UN Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.

If a supplier or other entity was found to be in material breach of the terms stipulated in their contract with us, including those specific to our human rights requirements or Code, we are able to suspend or terminate the contract with that supplier. In line with international guidance on best practice, and depending on the circumstances, we would try to work with the supplier to resolve any issues in a reasonable timeframe.

The Sustainability Policy emphasises our support for employment and community practises which empower people to make choices and have control over their process of development as it affects their lives, beliefs, institutions, well-being and the lands they occupy or otherwise use. The Sustainability Committee of the Board discharges its responsibilities with reference to the Sustainability Policy. We expect all of our suppliers to operate in line with the principles contained in our Sustainability Policy.

PARTNERING WITH SUPPLIERS, OUR OWN CROSS FUNCTIONAL TEAMS AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS, ENABLES US TO BETTER MANAGE AND ADDRESS MODERN SLAVERY RISKS

07
WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE SLAVERY FREE SUPPLY CHAINS

An integrated set of activities form our approach to combatting modern slavery risks in our supply chain.
We ensure accountability in our policies and processes by providing avenues for anyone to anonymously report any areas of concern to South32. If issues are raised

we conduct active due diligence (including audits on suppliers) to understand a suppliers approach to human rights and to ensure there are no modern slavery issues. We work in partnership to understand the practices of suppliers in our shared supply chain. This approach aims to identify, monitor and mitigate any modern slavery risks in our supply chain.

1.Supplier onboarding
››Pre-qualification of suppliers
››Contracts ››Internal policies and
business conduct requirements

2. Supplier high risk mapping and due diligence
››Supplier high risk mapping
››Active due diligence, including audits
››Workshops with subject matter experts

3. Training and capacity building
››Building relationships and supply chain transparency with suppliers
››Training and capacity building

4. Reporting concerns
››Complaints and grievances mechanisms at every operation
››An anonymous hotline in every location we operate (Ethicspoint)

1. SUPPLIER ONBOARDING
Our vendor pre-qualification forms and contracts include language stipulating that counterparties agree to adhere to our policies and standards. This provides a safeguard that we onboard and work with vendors who operate to the same standard we expect from ourselves.

South32 does not conduct direct audits on every supplier in our supply chain. Rather, in accordance with accepted international guidance,3 we identify and conduct due diligence on suppliers who are high risk for modern slavery. We categorise our suppliers as high risk on the basis of geography and whether the product we purchase has been assessed as high risk in international guidance and government registers.

2. SUPPLIER HIGH RISK MAPPING AND DUE DILIGENCE
Our Code of Business Conduct, Sustainability Policy, values, internal supply standard and approach to community and security provide clear and explicit minimum human rights requirements for our operations.
While South32 has a strong governance framework, we continuously aim to improve our processes and we view modern slavery due diligence as an ongoing risk management process.

We also categorise according to contract value, in order to determine our influence on the identified high risk suppliers. Workshops are then run to select the highest risk suppliers that we will conduct due diligence with in that financial year.
In FY17 we have conducted due diligence activities in partnership with major suppliers of clothing and electronics, who have themselves conducted extensive work on their own supply chains. No instances of modern slavery have been found.

3 Principle 17, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

08

In partnership, our highest risk suppliers identified in FY17 worked with us to:
■■ Share their human rights and modern slavery company policies and procedures
■■ Share information about their ethical sourcing journeys, including “lessons learnt”
■■ Provide insight and transparency into our shared supply chains several tiers down by sharing their modern slavery audits of their suppliers with us
The results of our due diligence have demonstrated that other organisations are willing to work together to address modern slavery risks.
When engaging with our supply chain, if we determine that insufficient due diligence has been completed, we may complete compliance audits to address any modern slavery risks.
We will continue to build relationships and work together across organisations to address modern slavery risks across our shared supply chains.
3. TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING
South32 employees and contractors receive training on our business conduct framework, including our human rights requirements. In FY17 we provided specific modern slavery training for all supply team employees and South32 contract owners who were identified as more likely to encounter modern slavery risks.

“Understanding the magnitude of modern slavery and the pivotal role supply plays was a key takeaway from the training. It has always been part of our vendor screening process, but now it is an active discussion point.”
- South32 supply team category lead
4. REPORTING CONCERNS
We have a complaints and grievances mechanism at every operation. This allows community members and other interested stakeholders to raise issues directly with our operations. We respond to all complaints and grievances and aim to resolve any issues as soon as possible. We report all complaints and grievances statistics in our Communities and Society document which forms part of our Annual Reporting Suite, and can be found on our website, www.south32.net.
In addition to the complaints and grievances mechanisms we have in place at our operations, we have an independent, multi-lingual worldwide service (EthicsPoint, found at south32.ethicspoint.com) for anyone to anonymously report concerns about the behaviour of our employees or those representing us, including concerns related to modern slavery.

316,"HP Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement
HP is committed to acting with integrity, fairness, and accountability, which we believe are fundamental principles underlying an inclusive society and a thriving business. We are uncompromising in our expectations of ethical behavior by our employees, partners, and suppliers. In the following statement published pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act 20151, we discuss our efforts to address modern slavery during the fiscal year ended October 31 2016 (“2016”). Modern slavery, as defined in guidance under the Act2, can manifest itself in different ways, including through slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking. We use these terms interchangeably when describing HP’s existing programs and policies. Our statement covers HP Inc. and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires, references to “HP,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to HP Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
HP’s Business and Supply Chain
HP is a fortune 100 company with over $48 billion in net revenue for 2016, operating in 62 countries, with approximately 49,000 employees. Our printing business provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, media and services, as well as scanning devices. Our personal systems business provides commercial personal computers (“PCs”), consumer PCs, workstations, thin clients, tablets, retail point-of-sale systems, calculators and other related accessories, software, support and services for the commercial and consumer markets.
From PCs to printers, HP’s unique products require a vast network of suppliers spanning six continents and many tens of thousands of companies. Our aim is to use this large supply chain influence to enable economic opportunities and drive lasting improvements for everyone, everywhere. We have approximately 700 manufacturing suppliers that produce the products we sell and several thousand
1 Modern Slavery Act 2015, Section 54 – Transparency in supply chains etc. 2 Transparency in Supply Chains etc. A practical guide.

non-manufacturing suppliers that support our operations. We disclose the names of about 80 of our manufacturing suppliers, which in 2016 comprised almost 90% of our manufacturing spend. Our products are manufactured in more than 45 countries and territories, but more than half of our manufacturing is based in the Asia Pacific region.
We have multi-year agreements in place with our major manufacturing suppliers. These long-term contracts and relationships allow us the opportunity to build awareness and capability to meet our expectations for supply chain responsibility, including the implementation of policies and processes to address the risks of modern slavery.
Our supply chain responsibility program primarily focuses on engagement with the suppliers with whom we have a direct contractual relationship, our manufacturing suppliers. We also require that these suppliers mirror our expectations with their suppliers. Where we do not have direct relationships, we believe that industry collaboration can be used to appropriately create influence in order to drive change. As part of our commitment to address modern slavery, we strive to identify and participate in such collaboration.
HP’s Policies
HP Governance Integrity is the foundation of HP’s global business and our promise to customers and communities. We hold our leaders, employees, suppliers, and business partners to the highest ethical standards and require their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2002, aligning our strategies with their ten universal principles, including those addressing human rights and labor. The HP Board of Directors’ Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee oversees HP’s policies and programs relating to global citizenship and other legal, regulatory, and compliance matters regarding current and emerging political, environmental, global citizenship, and public policy trends. HP’s Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer oversees implementation of our Standards of Business Conduct. HP’s Chief Supply Chain Officer oversees implementation of our human rights commitments (found within our Sustainability Policy) and designs processes to prevent, mitigate, and remediate related impacts.
HP Operations Core expectations for our own operations are clearly described in HP’s Standards of Business Conduct. HP’s Sustainability Policy includes our commitment to take action against the offenses that comprise modern slavery as well as other expectations regarding human rights, such as ethical behavior, dignity and respect, health and safety, fair employment, freedom of association, and privacy. Our employees are expected to report any concerns they have with respect to non-conformance with any of these policies, and our management is expected to act upon any such concerns. Contingent workers must similarly comply with the HP Contingent Worker Code of Conduct.
Supply Chain Key expectations of our suppliers are contained in HP's Supplier Code of Conduct, which incorporates international labor and human rights principles. Our contracts with those suppliers require them to ensure that workers associated with HP production at supplier facilities have: (i) the right to freely chosen employment; (ii) the right, in accordance with local laws, to join labor unions on a voluntary basis, to bargain collectively as they choose and to engage in peaceful assembly; and (iii) the right to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. HP's manufacturing suppliers also agree that their operations comply with applicable laws regarding forced labor and human trafficking.

We recognize that certain groups of workers in our supply chain may be more vulnerable than others to risks of modern slavery and have developed two specialized standards that are applied in targeted jurisdictions.
• To protect young workers (16 and 17 years old), contracted dispatch workers, and students, we require suppliers with facilities in the People's Republic of China to conform to our Student and Dispatch Worker Standard. This standard requires that students make up no more than 20% of the workforce, and that all student work is voluntary, meets local regulations, and furthers a student's education.
• We believe foreign migrant workers are especially at risk for exploitative labor practices and forced labor. To respect their rights, HP became the first IT company to set requirements for suppliers on how they recruit, select, hire, and manage such workers. Our Foreign Migrant Worker Standard requires direct employment of foreign migrant workers by our suppliers, as well as prohibiting retention of worker passports and personal documentation and the elimination of worker-paid recruitment fees.
How HP detects and addresses the risks of modern slavery
HP Operations Pursuant to the policies for our operations outlined above, HP employees and contingent workers are prohibited from engaging in trafficking in persons, which includes but is not limited to the illegal movement of people, trafficking in persons, sexual exploitation, and the use of forced or child labor of any form. When recruiting HP employees, information provided to potential candidates about the prospective work must be truthful and candidates are not to be charged applicant or recruiting fees.
HP maintains a strong culture of open communications. We encourage anyone with a concern to speak up without fear of retaliation. Multiple communication channels make it convenient for employees and other stakeholders, such as business partners and customers, to ask questions or report a concern to HP.
Any concerns or alleged violations of our Standards of Business Conduct or the Sustainability Policy are taken seriously and responded to quickly, with disciplinary or remedial actions where appropriate, up to and including termination.
To monitor and manage emerging risks, we record any allegations of child, forced or prison labor in a global case management system. This allows us to spot potential business and geographical trends that may affect these risks and determine whether additional controls are necessary. In 2016, we conducted a human rights assessment of functions that own relevant policies in order to review how their programs respect human rights.
Supply Chain HP’s supply chain responsibility program focuses on protecting and empowering workers while simultaneously creating benefits for us and our customers. With our supply chain policies and standards as a baseline, the closely related program elements of detecting and addressing the risks of modern slavery are part of a broader approach to identify and mitigate social and environmental responsibility issues. HP works to identify and characterize sources of risk and their context, which can be identified at a global or regional level, and at the level of individual manufacturing and non-manufacturing suppliers.
Our manufacturing supplier risk assessment for indicators of modern slavery considers the supplier location, what they make, supplier reputational or business information, and external stakeholder information. Typically, if the supplier is considered a medium- or high-risk supplier, we require the completion of a

self-assessment questionnaire. HP reviews and provides feedback to the supplier and may require an improvement plan. To evaluate risks related to modern slavery, we analyze indicators such as employment of vulnerable worker groups, the use of third party agents in the recruitment or management of workers, and supplier operations in geographic areas that have elevated risks for forced labor or human trafficking. The information received through our risk assessment informs our annual manufacturing supplier audit prioritization process, capability building, and other program activities. If an audit is scheduled, it will evaluate the supplier’s conformance to HP’s Supplier Code of Conduct and/or specialized HP labor standards. In a typical year, we audit most high-risk manufacturing suppliers and conduct specialized assessments of student worker and foreign migrant worker policy conformance for selected manufacturing suppliers. Our manufacturing supplier audits are conducted by independent third-party auditors through the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) Validated Audit Process or by trained and certified HP auditors.
For non-manufacturing suppliers, we start with a social and environmental responsibility risk assessment which considers industry risks associated with the particular category of products or services provided, the geographies in which the supplier operates and whether the country has elevated risks of modern slavery. Medium- or high-risk suppliers must complete a self-assessment questionnaire tailored to their particular industry. Supplier corrective action plans are developed as necessary, and HP auditors may conduct follow-up audits.
A finding of non-conformance with HP's Supplier Code of Conduct or specialized labor standards related to modern slavery does not necessarily indicate that an instance of forced labor or human trafficking has occurred, but may signal a lack of standard operations or procedures to prevent such an occurrence. Following a finding of non-conformance, suppliers are required to produce corrective action plans to resolve the issue. Our auditors are required to escalate any findings or indicators of modern slavery. Suppliers must immediately cease any practices contributing to a significant audit finding and report their corrective action to HP no later than 30 days after the original audit or specialized assessment. The finding will then be re-examined through a site visit to confirm resolution.
Assessment of effectiveness
HP Operations
During 2016, a total of 134 issues or concerns were reported by an employee, partner or stakeholder to our Standards of Business Conduct team or another compliance function. There were no reports of issues or concerns that were associated with modern slavery in our operations. In the 2016 HP human rights assessment of our operations, modern slavery was not identified as a risk that would have a severe negative impact that has a likelihood of occurring.
Supply Chain
During 2016, we conducted 141 manufacturing supplier audits and assessments (which included labor rights), approximately 76% of which were audits conducted by third-party auditors. For non-manufacturing suppliers, we conducted 33 assessments and 2 audits, all of which were conducted by HP auditors. Two types of significant labor-related non-conformances were found during engagements with two suppliers – 1) passport and personal document withholding, and 2) payment of recruitment fees. We required the issues to be immediately addressed and worked with the suppliers to implement corrective action plans. Our annual Sustainability Report (available by June 2017) summarizes manufacturing and non-manufacturing supplier audits, including the number of suppliers reviewed in our assurance program and the aggregated audit results.
Student dispatch worker performance: We track suppliers’ performance against the standards set forth in our Student and Dispatch Worker Standard for supplier

facilities in the People’s Republic of China, and take appropriate action when they fall short. During 2016, 92% of sites monitored maintained student worker levels at no more than 20% of the total workforce related to HP production.
The HP social and environmental responsibility manufacturing supplier scorecard is used to measure and incentivize supplier performance on a range of factors that includes audit results and other performance metrics. Suppliers who have exceptional performance realize benefit in their commercial relationship with HP. In 2016, the scorecard was used to evaluate select manufacturing suppliers representing approximately 50% of HP’s manufacturing spend. This process has enabled continuous supplier improvement.
Training
Our employees are trained annually on the HP Standards of Business Conduct, with a training completion rate of more than 99% of active employees. Following the promulgation of the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations combating human trafficking, our human resources recruiters were trained in 2015 to recognize indicators of human trafficking and on HP’s relevant policies on anti-human trafficking.
We seek to raise supplier awareness of and conformance to HP's Supplier Code of Conduct and specialized labor standards, including ways to identify and address the risks of modern slavery. HP's supply chain capability building programs have included, for example, worker-management communications training, which provides employees access to mechanisms to raise issues with management or superiors. We have conducted three rounds of workshops to train 152 factory managers on our expectations for student workers, juvenile workers, and young workers in China. Our training modules on social media platforms, such as WeChat, drew close to 700 new subscribers.
In addition to our internal processes and programs, we strongly believe that partnership with other companies and key stakeholders is critical to facing the challenges of modern slavery. We work through the EICC to create and share leading practices and programs to advance improvements to the EICC Code of Conduct and capabilities of EICC suppliers. We seize opportunities to cooperate across the broader business community, for instance becoming one of the founding members of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruiting, which is focusing on eradicating worker-paid fees. We continue to partner with other leading IT companies to conduct training sessions for Southeast Asian suppliers and labor agents on best practices to prevent risks associated with modern slavery in the recruitment and employment of foreign migrant workers.
In closing, we believe our role as a global company is to respect human rights around the world, both in our operations and by influencing our suppliers through our business relationships. Combating modern slavery requires persistence, ongoing due diligence, and continuous improvement. This work is consistent with the fundamentals and core values that HP was founded on: to make a difference in the world and the communities where we operate.

Modern Slavery Statement
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Paul Smith Limited’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 30 June 2018.
Introduction
At Paul Smith we are absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in our corporate activities, and to ensuring that our supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.
Our Business
Founded in the 1970’s, Paul Smith is a global business designing & selling high quality clothing, shoe and accessory collections for men and women in six continents. We also license others to produce and sell eyewear, fragrance, children’s clothing and interior products and in Japan license the production and sale of men’s and women’s clothing.
Our distribution methods remain the same as in previous years; we sell our products through three main channels; our own shops and website, wholesale both in store and on line and licenced partners. From time to time we also expand our offer through a range of product collaboration projects.
Paul Smith Group Holdings Limited is the ultimate parent company of the global Paul Smith group, including Paul Smith Holdings Limited and our main UK trading company, Paul Smith Limited. Our registered office is at The Poplars, Lenton Lane, Nottingham, NG7 2PW, England.
Our Employees
The Paul Smith group now has over 1,300 employees worldwide. We have thorough recruitment practices in which we check all our employees’ eligibility to work and we are confident that there is no risk of slavery and human trafficking within our group.
Our Supply Chains
Our Products Our product supply chain remains stable and we continue to source our fabrics and components from circa 350 suppliers with the majority located in Italy and engage circa 300 factories to manufacture our products, over half of which located in Europe.
Indirect Suppliers We also contract with suppliers for a broad spectrum of goods and services which are important to our business operations but which do not feed into our product production, such as information technology, shop fittings, till systems, logistics.
Our Policies
At Paul Smith we are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business and we have zero tolerance to any such practices. All factories we work with are required to adhere to ethical working practices, which include but are not limited to complying with key principles of ensuring that: employment is freely chosen and that freedom of association and other workers’ rights are respected; the required standards of working conditions are met and the conditions will be safe and hygienic; workers’ hours are not excessive and that regular employment is provided; there is no use of child labour; and that no discrimination or harsh or inhumane treatment will be practiced or allowed in their organisation.
Update from Previous Year
In our last statement we intended to continue to look at ways to further expand our practices to ensure as far as possible that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains. As such we are continuing to expand our compliance requirements in a staged approach across our entire supply chain and we have now:
• Expanded our Supplier Code of Conduct and Self-Assessment Audits to cover not only the factories but also the mills we work with.
• Set up a register and process to monitor the completed Self-Assessments Audits.
• Included clauses to specifically address the Modern Slavery Act 2015 in any relevant contracts with 3rd parties that have been renewed during this financial year.
• Any new contracts with 3rd parties include, if appropriate, requirements to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Going Forward we will
• Continue to expand our compliance requirements throughout our supply chain and to reinforce an ever-present high awareness and understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our business.
• Continue to monitor the processes we have put in place to date to evaluate their effectiveness.
• Investigate membership of various external organisations that may provide additional support in developing transparency in our supply chain and therefore minimising the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking.
• Investigate additional training programmes for staff.
During this financial year ending June 2018 we have not uncovered any incidents or indicators of modern slavery in our supply chain. This statement covers Paul Smith Group Holdings Limited, Paul Smith (Holdings) Limited and Paul Smith Limited and has been approved and signed by each company’s board of directors on 28th November 2018.

318,"TRANSPARENCY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
Modern Slavery Act 2015 and Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
Burberry Group plc statement
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657). It sets out the steps we have taken during the financial year 2017/18 (the “Year”) to prevent slavery and human trafficking from taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our business.
INTRODUCTION
As a global luxury retailer and manufacturer, with more than 10,000 employees, 449 retail locations and a supply chain touching the lives of thousands of people worldwide, we are acutely aware of our responsibilities as well as the opportunities to drive positive change.
In 2017, we launched our new five-year responsibility strategy called ‘Creating Tomorrow’s Heritage’. It sets out ambitious goals to address our most material social and environmental impacts, while supporting the Burberry Foundation (UK registered charity number 1154468) in creating long-term partnerships that fuel innovation and transform communities.
We published our second Modern Slavery Statement in June 2017 and over the past year have continued to increase the depth and breadth of our ethical trading programme, building further awareness and understanding throughout the business, delving deeper into our modern slavery risks and collaborating with cross-industry groups, such as the Business Against Slavery Forum, to target modern slavery.
OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
We design, develop, make and sell luxury products under the Burberry brand and our business model is focused on creating long term sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
Design At our London headquarters, our design studio acts as the creative hub for our business. A team of highly talented, artistic designers create authentic and distinctive luxury products. Bringing new fashion-forward offerings and reinvigorating core heritage categories.
Develop When bringing designs to life, we are continuously looking for ways to innovate within both new and heritage assortments. We develop and explore new materials, techniques and combinations with sustainability in mind.
Make We carefully source the best fabrics, materials and finished products based on their high quality and sustainability. Expert craftsmen and women combine traditional techniques with modern technology to create best in class, desirable collections.
Distribute & Sell Our products are sold globally through our directly operated store network, and online at Burberry.com, as well as through franchisees and multi-brand, third-party partners, both offline and online. In a few selected areas, such as Eyewear and Beauty, we use the product and distribution expertise of licensing partners.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
We have a supply chain network that exists to support the production of our apparel and accessories products, as well as networks relating to our day-to-day business operations.
Apparel & Accessories Finished products are manufactured at both company-owned facilities in the UK and through an external supplier network. A large proportion of our finished goods production takes place in Europe, where Burberry has many long-standing relationships, many lasting over 15 years. We believe that these strong supplier relationships are the key to ensuring continuous improvement in supply chain working conditions and avoiding supplier turnover where possible.
Raw Materials In addition to the supply chain for finished goods, we are also aware of the importance of our raw material supply chain and the sustainability of raw material suppliers. This year, we continued to expand our responsibility programme to also include the assessment of mills, tanneries and trim suppliers and their sub-contractors.
Licensees We have granted two product category licences under the Burberry brand to third parties, namely to Coty to produce beauty products and to Luxottica to produce eyewear. Our Responsibility team works with Coty and Luxottica to ensure they apply consistent standards which are aligned with those applied across the rest of Burberry’s supply chain.
Business Operations As a large global organisation, we have many other supply chains across EMEIA, Americas and Asia Pacific related to general business operations, including but not limited to retail stores, our website, offices, marketing and transport. We continue to communicate our commitments and policies designed to prevent forced, bonded and trafficked labour through our Responsible Business Principles (the “Principles”). Further details are set out below.
POLICIES
We believe that respect for human rights is integral to being a responsible company. The prevention of forced, bonded and trafficked labour is a key element of Burberry’s Human Rights Policy and Ethical Trading Code of Conduct: Burberry Policies.
To promote Human Rights across our direct and indirect business operations, we require our network of business associates and extended supply chain to comply with our Responsible Business Principles (“Principles”) (formerly known as the Ethical Trading Policy).
The Principles have been developed and informed by our longstanding membership of the United Nations Global Compact and the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), and are underpinned by the International Bill of Human Rights and the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization. The Principles apply to all our business associates, which include, but are not limited to: finished goods suppliers, raw material suppliers, non-stock suppliers, construction contractors, licensees and franchisees.
The Principles were reviewed in 2016 to better address modern slavery risks and ensure that modern slavery provisions are contractually covered in all our business partnerships. The Principles are overseen by Burberry’s Ethics Committee, chaired by our Chief People, Strategy and Corporate Affairs Officer. The policies are monitored by our Responsibility and Supply Chain teams and enforced according to the Burberry Non-Compliance Policy, detailed below.
The Principles include the following policies, as well as Burberry’s Code of Ethical Business Principles, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Global Environmental Policy:
Ethical Trading Code of Conduct This outlines requirements which all our business associates must uphold in relation to their own employees and throughout their own supply chain. The code includes, amongst other standards, the following requirements: that employment is freely chosen, child labour is not used, freedom of association is respected and no harsh or inhumane treatment occurs.
The full Code of Conduct is available here: Burberry Ethical Trading Code of Conduct .

Burberry Migrant Worker Policy This is specifically intended to protect workers who may be potentially vulnerable to exploitation in the course of international migration. The Policy contains requirements in relation to, but not limited to, the withholding of passports and similar documents and the levying of recruitment fees.
The full Migrant Worker Policy is available here: Burberry Migrant Worker Policy.
Burberry Human Rights Policy Burberry’s Human Rights Policy sets out our four key stakeholder groups – our people, workers in our supply chain, our customers and our communities - and the procedures we have put in place to protect and uphold human rights, including mechanisms in place to address any instances of potential infringement. The policy was developed with reference to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We assess human rights impacts and monitor labour conditions in both our own operations and our supply chain on a regular basis to ensure the policy is upheld. Further details of Burberry’s Human Rights Policy are available here: Burberry Human Rights Policy
Responsible Sourcing Policy This outlines Burberry’s commitment to responsible and sustainable business principles throughout the supply chain, including at the sourcing stage of raw materials. The policy outlines specific prohibited sourcing regions, where the risk of modern slavery and other labour rights issues is recognised. For example, the policy prohibits any sourcing of cotton from Uzbekistan.
Further details of the Responsible Sourcing Policy are available here: Burberry Responsible Sourcing Policy.
Partner Non-Compliance Policy Where breaches of our standards and policies are identified, Burberry collaborates to find solutions to address the non-compliance. Where improvements are not made within a given time or there is an unwillingness to address the issue, we may consider terminating a particular business relationship.
However, the policy is designed to allow partners a reasonable amount of time to rectify any noncompliance with the Principles, to minimise any potential detrimental impact on workers’ livelihoods.
In addition to the Responsible Business Principles, Burberry’s Ways of Working provide a set of guidelines which all employees must abide by, relating to a wide range of matters including personal conduct and whistleblowing.
We continue to implement additional risk management of our non-stock procurement supply chain, to gain more visibility of areas of greater risk, such as labour suppliers globally and construction contractors. All stock and non-stock suppliers are required to take responsibility for the prevention of forced, bonded and trafficked labour in their supply chain and certify that neither they nor any of their affiliates, contractors or sub-contractors engage or have engaged in any form of modern slavery.
Compliance with the Principles is a requirement of doing business with Burberry. We work with our business associates to support their compliance, and may act against those that do not demonstrate sufficient commitment to the Principles or are in breach of them. In the event of a business associate being found to be involved in modern slavery, we would act to first help safeguard the workers’ wellbeing and then to support the business associate with its remediation process including any actions to identify and address root cause issues.
GOVERNANCE
We continue to promote the management of modern slavery risks within and external to Burberry. In October 2017, the Home Secretary invited some of the UK’s largest companies, including Burberry, to join the Business Against Slavery Forum. Alongside Burberry’s CEO, Marco Gobbetti, seven founding members have begun to share intelligence and best practice to help businesses, inside and outside the forum, to identify, tackle and prevent slavery in their supply chains.
We have a global Responsibility team consisting of around 30 specialists, based in key product supply chain locations such as the UK, Italy and Hong Kong. Although ethical trading activities are coordinated by our Responsibility team, targets relating to working conditions in the supply chain are owned by our Supply Chain and relevant sourcing teams. Burberry employees, who are responsible for supply chain partner relationships and sourcing, also have personal KPIs related to labour conditions, recognising the potential

impact of fair purchasing practices on labour conditions throughout our supply chain.
Our Ethical Trading Programme is supported and monitored internally by a number of management committees. The Programme aims to ensure that the potential risks to labour and human rights are considered at all appropriate levels and areas of the business.
In the event that any labour or human rights risks are identified, the Chief People, Strategy and Corporate Affairs Officer will report on such issues to the Group Risk Committee, which meets at least three times a year.
Additionally, our ethical trading targets and sustainability strategy are reviewed by the Burberry Responsibility Advisory Committee (BRAC), including international NGOs Forum for the Future and Oxfam. This forum provides an important opportunity to gain an outside perspective on our programmes and determine whether we are focusing our actions and resources on the most salient labour rights’ risks throughout our operations.
DUE DILIGENCE & ASSESSMENT OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
For almost 15 years, we have had a programme aimed at safeguarding the labour conditions in our product supply chains.
Monitoring and verification activities are carried out throughout our finished goods and key raw material supply chain to support compliance with the Principles. To ensure our supply chain mapping stays up to date, we operate a strict approval process and conduct a transparency analysis with our vendors and commercial teams each season.
New raw material suppliers are required to confirm they will adhere to the Principles and comply with applicable local laws. They agree that we may visit and assess their own compliance as well as that of their suppliers. Before any new supplier is approved to participate in the Burberry supply chain, they are risk assessed for social compliance and any indication of forced, bonded or trafficked labour.
In addition, before a factory is approved to produce Burberry finished goods, its compliance with the Principles and applicable local laws is assessed and the Burberry Responsibility Team must be satisfied of the factory’s commitment to the Principles. Audits, announced or unannounced, consist of worker interviews, document reviews and site tours, and are repeated periodically to confirm ongoing compliance and continuous improvement. The frequency of these audits depends on the level of performance in the last audit – better performing factories are audited less frequently. Worker interviews are always conducted confidentially and workers are selected at random, whilst at the same time ensuring a fair representation of the workforce, including, for example, union and worker representatives, first aiders and migrant workers. Between audits, our Responsibility Team works closely with facilities to implement preventative systems and improve the management of human rights and safety risks, amongst others. During the period 2017/18, 446 audits and 263 engagement visits were conducted.
Assessing Our Human Rights Impact In 2014, we conducted a Human Rights Impact Assessment, developed with human rights specialists Ergon Associates. This assessment highlighted some areas of our business operations where there was a potential human rights risk was reviewed by Ergon and discussed with Oxfam. Following this, we have implemented several action plans in both our direct operations and supply chain, including for example the construction of retail stores and office space, as the construction industry is known for potentially high human rights risks in relation to both local and migrant workers.
Since the exercise, we have been working with internal teams to promote transparency and, this year, have conducted our first ethical trading assessment at a construction site. We are now developing a strategy based on the modern slavery risks identified, to ensure all future construction projects have appropriate management systems in place to mitigate any potential modern slavery risks.
Other areas identified in the assessment include recruitment practices in all owned and third-party distribution centres globally, promotion of access to remedy in our key supply chain locations, and upholding of labour rights in our raw material supply chains.
Where we have identified a salient forced labour risk in our raw material supplier facilities, ethical trading assessments have been conducted by a local NGO to identify any labour rights risks and remediate these

with the help of local expertise.
We are conscious that monitoring alone does not drive improvements in labour conditions and therefore have several other programmes in place to support our supply chain partners:
Worker Grievance Mechanism In China, labour rights issues can include inadequate access to remedy. We have worked with three local Non-Governmental Organisations to establish a hotline providing over 10,000 workers with improved access to remedy.
In 2017/18, the hotline was rolled out to all factories in China with regular production of Burberry products. The effectiveness of the hotline is continuously reviewed and, during 2017/18, 588 calls (42 complaints, 469 consulting and 77 psychological support) and their resolutions were monitored closely by our local Responsibility team.
Worker Wellbeing We continue to work on programmes to capture comments and grievances from workers in our supply chain globally.
This year, we have worked with Oxfam to develop a series of metrics to measure worker wellbeing in our supply chain and capture comments and feedback from workers.
The new tool has been tested in our own factory in Yorkshire, England, and is now being piloted in a further three, key manufacturing facilities.
TRAINING & RESOURCES
Our Responsibility team includes specialists on labour and human rights, including modern slavery. All Burberry employees are introduced to Burberry’s Corporate Responsibility policies and programmes during their induction training, to ensure a general understanding of Burberry’s responsibilities in this area.
Informed by Burberry’s Human Rights Impact Assessment, a bespoke modern slavery and labour rights training programme has been developed in collaboration with ethical trade, human rights and labour standards consultancy, Impactt. The training has been delivered to key employee groups who interact with Burberry’s supply chain networks. The targeted training is intended to support those travelling to supply chain facilities, to ensure they are familiar with the risk areas, likely indications of human rights abuses (including instances of modern slavery) and possible actions to take if an incident of modern slavery is identified. In addition, we have trained members of our human resources, health and safety, construction and fulfilment functions on modern slavery, on how to identify it and appropriate actions to take. The training has helped to embed Burberry’s policy of zero tolerance for modern slavery and respect for human rights throughout the business. An online training programme designed to boost awareness is now being rolled out to relevant employee groups at all levels. We plan to provide a refresher training every two years.
In 2016/17, we provided tailored training on identification and combatting of modern slavery to suppliers. In-person training sessions were held with finished goods vendors who together manufacture 72% of our product. Initially, this training was provided to key finished goods and raw material suppliers, third-party labour contractors and certain suppliers operating in sectors with a greater risk of modern slavery issues arising. Participants were required to develop and implement plans around the recruitment and ongoing management of workers, to reduce the risk of modern slavery in their operations and supply chain. These action plans continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis by our Responsibility team.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Internal Training We have trained 112 employees from teams working with our business and product supply chains. Teams completing the training include Sourcing, Product Development, HR, Legal, Construction, Procurement and Workplace Service.
Supply Chain Training We have trained finished goods suppliers, their subcontractors and key raw material suppliers on the identification of modern slavery and building systems to prevent the occurrence of modern slavery.

Worker Voice We continue to identify initiatives to strengthen workers’ abilities to access information, raise grievances and measure worker wellbeing. This year, Burberry’s worker hotline received 588 calls, categorised as 42 complaints, 469 consulting calls and 77 psychological support calls.
Audits & Assessments In 2017/18, we conducted 446 audits and 263 engagement visits or trainings. The majority of these activities are conducted by our internal Responsibility team to build trust in our ongoing partnerships and drive continuous improvement together.
LOOKING AHEAD
We continue to implement the action plans resulting from our 2017 Human Rights Impact Assessment and believe that a continuing focus on transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain can help identify modern slavery risks.
We continue to review our own business operations and procurement procedures to ensure that risks of modern slavery are considered.
Should any instances of modern slavery be identified, we believe we are well positioned to address these and to support any affected workers in line with our core values.

MODERN SLAVERY ACT
GLOBALLY RESPONSIBLE

Legal Services Fiduciary Services Fund Services Regulatory & Compliance Entity Formation & Management

We have committed to support the objectives of the Modern Slavery Act, not just within the UK but on a global, group-wide basis.

This statement is published on behalf of Maples and Calder, Maples Fiduciary Services (UK) Limited and Maples and Calder Services Europe Limited (the ""UK entities"") with reference to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ""Act"") (the ""Statement""). The Statement covers the current financial year.
The Maples Group includes Maples and Calder, an international law firm advising clients around the world on the laws of the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Jersey and Luxembourg. In each jurisdiction in which Maples and Calder has a presence, a separate undertaking or entity called Maples and Calder has been established including Maples and Calder in London, an unlimited liability company registered in England and Wales (Company No. 03369233). The Maples Group also includes MaplesFS (including Maples Fiduciary Services and Maples Fund Services) an independent provider of specialised fiduciary, fund administration, entity formation and management and trust and private client services. In the UK, Maples Fiduciary Services (UK) Limited is a private limited company (Company No. 09422850). The Maples Group has also established Maples and Calder Services Europe Limited in the UK (a private limited company with Company No. 07052645) to provide certain support services to other entities within the Maples Group. At present, the UK operations of the UK entities do not meet the criteria to require a statement under the Act. Notwithstanding this, the UK entities regard the Act and its objectives as a necessary measure to counter slavery and human trafficking and are therefore pleased to publish the steps that are being taken in this Statement.
We acquire goods and services from suppliers in the UK and elsewhere to support the services we provide to our clients and the Maples Group generally. We have committed to support the objectives of the Act not just within the UK but on a global, group wide basis. The Maples Group is opposed to slavery and human trafficking and has policies and procedures in place, including in relation to anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing and anti-bribery and anti-corruption, which prohibit the facilitation of criminal enterprises. Although as a professional services provider we believe the risk of slavery or human trafficking existing within our business to be low, we are taking steps to ensure we identify any links to, or risks of, being connected with slavery or human trafficking.
We continue to conduct due diligence and monitor our contractors and suppliers to ensure that (i) we know who we are working with and the source of goods and services we acquire; and (ii) that our contractors and suppliers are not susceptible to slavery and human trafficking. We are committed to best practice in this regard and ensuring that slavery and human trafficking do not exist in our supply chains. In the event that we do identify any links between a supplier and slavery and/or human trafficking we will insist on that supplier taking remedial steps or we will terminate the relationship.
The Maples Group trains staff on induction and annually on various policies and procedures we have in place to prohibit the facilitation of criminal enterprise which includes helping our people identify risk factors and indicators of possible slavery and human trafficking. Internally, our core values include people and teamwork to achieve the best results for our clients - you can find more details about our values, commitments to diversity and inclusion and corporate social responsibility and community projects on our About Us page.

Footasylum plc takes an active role in policing compliance in this area. Last year the business identified a number of risk indicators to the Business and detailed how it would address those areas for concern. The approach included:
Establishing the ‘Supplier Code of Conduct’ for our goods and service suppliers which all existing and new suppliers are required to sign and adhere to. Copies of which are stored at Head Office.
Establishing an Ethical Sourcing Policy which details the above mentioned Code of Conduct. This Policy details our commitment as a Business and our expectations of the suppliers that we work with.
Guidance and training provided to all relevant personnel with regard to identifying potential risks during supplier visits and appropriate escalation processes.
This year, following on from the above, Footasylum plc are working to improve the transparency lower down the supply chain and with support of a new Supplier Manual will aim to ensure that any manufacturers who sub contract work on behalf of the Business also comply with our Code of Conduct and Ethical Sourcing Policies. The Business aims to conduct due diligence visits attended by both internal employees and external auditors to determine the compliance of suppliers and manufacturers. To date, Footasylum plc has not been informed of any incidents of slavery or human trafficking however will investigate thoroughly and take the appropriate action as per our supplier terms of contract. In conclusion, Footasylum plc is committed to continually assessing slavery and human trafficking via internal and external auditing, both in the workplace, and externally through our supply chain and in all cases will address any incidents identified.

SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING POLICY STATEMENT
Pursuant to Section 3 of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and the United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery Act 2015, Chapter 30, Part 6, Provision 54, ON Semiconductor states that we have taken steps during the financial year to identify the risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place in any of our supply chains and in any part of our business.
As a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) -- a nonprofit coalition of electronics companies committed to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities engaged in the global electronics supply chain -- we publicly demonstrate our commitment to environmental and social responsibility. EICC members commit to the EICC Code of Conduct (Code) and are expected to actively pursue conformance to the Code through all of our internal operations, as well as our supply chain. The latest EICC Code of Conduct states:
Forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery or trafficking of persons shall not be used. This includes transporting, harboring, recruiting, transferring or receiving persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction or fraud for labor or services. There shall be no unreasonable restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement in the facility in addition to unreasonable restrictions on entering or exiting company-provided facilities. As part of the hiring process, workers must be provided with a written employment agreement in their native language that contains a description of terms and conditions of employment prior to the worker departing from his or her country of origin. All work must be voluntary and workers shall be free to leave work at any time or terminate their employment. Employers and agents may not hold or otherwise destroy, conceal, confiscate or deny access by employees to their identity or immigration documents, such as government-issued identification, passports or work permits, unless such holdings are required by law. Workers shall not be required to pay employers’ or agents’ recruitment fees or other related fees for their employment. If any such fees are found to have been paid by workers, such fees shall be repaid to the worker.
The focus on slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort of supply chain transparency and accountability. We partner with our supply chain to create an environment where workers have the right to freely choose employment, the right to associate freely, voluntarily join or not join labor unions and worker councils, and the right to bargain collectively if they choose.
ON Semiconductor has taken multiple actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain, including the following:
1
Doc#: 185955v2

1. Verification: We evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery through conformance to the Code. All key supplies are required to agree and comply with the Code and ON Semiconductor’s corporate social responsibility and environmental requirements. We pursue conformance by using statement of commitment agreements with our suppliers, the EICC’s Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaires, and the Validated Audit Process (VAP).
a. The Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) is a self-evaluation that inquires about demographics and existing policies at the facility level against all sections of the Code.
b. The VAP audits carried out on EICC member facilities and their suppliers' facilities are completed by independent, third-party auditors specially trained in social and environmental auditing and the VAP audit protocol. This helps to set consistent, industry-wide expectations.
We conduct these activities regularly and extensively. • Every two years we ask our key suppliers to re-sign the Statement of Conformance to
the Corporate Social Responsibility tenets and the EICC Code. Major material suppliers and external manufacturing sites that are in the top 80 percent of the company’s spend must also complete a self-assessment questionnaire. All new sitelevel suppliers are required to comply with the EICC Code of Conduct, whereas selfassessment questionnaires are optional (but highly encouraged). • In 2015, over 200 of our key suppliers re-signed their statement of commitment agreements to ON Semiconductor and the EICC Code of Conduct. Sixty-five of these key suppliers were all of our top corporate suppliers – i.e. those suppliers who represent 80 percent of the ON Semiconductor’s spending at suppliers who supply to multiple sites or whose contracts are managed at a corporate level. The remaining key suppliers were all of our top site suppliers – i.e. those suppliers who represent 20 percent of a given manufacturing site’s spending excluding spending at corporate suppliers. In total, 266 suppliers submitted or updated their self-assessment questionnaire.
The EICC also convenes regular teleconferences, webinars and other meetings that make us better able to understand and monitor risk associated with labor recruitment practices.
2. Supplier Audits: We audit suppliers that we identify as having “higher risk” in our supply chain. The risk evaluation includes feedback from our supplier assessments and company contacts. These audits are announced and conducted by a third party firm certified to conduct EICC or corporate social responsibility (CSR) audits. Annually we audit 25 percent of our higher risk suppliers.
3. Certification: Section E 12 of the EICC Code includes a clause stating that companies should have a management system that contains “a process to communicate the Code requirements and to monitor supplier compliance to the Code.”. Our manufacturing sites with foreign workers have a rigorous selection process to ensure the labor agencies at both sending and receiving country are following the law and our Code requirements.
2
Doc#: 185955v2

The labor agencies are required to sign service agreements to adhere to the Code, which we ask them to re-sign biennially. Once selected, the company or a third party, audits the labor agencies for continued compliance.
As a member of the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI) suppliers and smelters in our supply chain must certify that they are not supplying us materials from conflict regions.
4. Internal Accountability: Noncompliance with the EICC Code on slavery and trafficking is taken very seriously. It is considered one of the most severe types of nonconformance and corrective action plans to remedy any identified instances of nonconformance are expected to be implemented at the shortest possible timeline. The company’s internal manufacturing sites are audited every two years to the EICC Code and requirements. These audits are announced and conducted by a third party firm certified to conduct EICC or corporate social responsibility (CSR) audits. Any deficiencies in the management system, internal and external audits and appropriate actions are logged in our corrective action plan.
Our internal auditors, some of whom are certified by the EICC, perform internal audits against the EICC Code at ON Semiconductor manufacturing sites biennially. The audit criteria cover five main areas based on EICC Audit Protocol including labor, ethics, health and safety, environment and management systems and include corrective actions.
In 2016, 11 out of ON Semiconductor’s 25 manufacturing facilities were subject to internal audits and 10 manufacturing sites participated in initial or closing EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP) audits. Five of our sites also participated in customer audits or shared EICC Validated Audit Reports (VAR) with customers.
5. Capacity-Building/Training: EICC’s Learning Academy contains online learning modules that cover the EICC Code of Conduct, as well as modules specifically related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. In addition, there are modules on hiring and related topics that are particularly relevant to these issues. Modules can be assigned to both internal staff and suppliers, and learning can be tracked. Members can also upload their own resources to the Learning Academy for their teams. The EICC encourages members to share any resources they may have on these topics with the EICC for sharing in the Learning Academy. The EICC also offers in-person training sessions on a variety of topics.
We conduct training regularly and extensively. • We ensure training is conducted on the EICC Code of Conduct through participation
in EICC code interpretation, EICC Labor and Ethics Lead Auditor Training, EICC worker communication classes and/or internally developed training classes which are available for all employee levels of the organization. • In November 2016, ON Semiconductor launched a mandatory EICC industry standards training for all employees. In total, almost 100 percent of approximately 30,000employees completed the training in 2016.
3
Doc#: 185955v2

• In 2016, our key suppliers and eligible on-site service providers received training on EICC Code Standards: Labor, Ethics, and Management Systems and on EICC Course 2: Industry Standards. In doing so, ON Semiconductor aims to mitigate risk by creating dialogue and encouraging capacity building.
This disclosure includes the efforts ON Semiconductor has taken in our own business, as well as our suppliers, to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain and our own business. These efforts, as well as this disclosure, are reviewed by our Board of Directors annually and updated publicly. For complete information concerning our corporate social responsibility program see our ON Semiconductor Corporate Social Responsibility page: Corporate Social Responsibility.

324,"MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT
This statement has been made according to the requirements of section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 for the financial year ending 31 December 2016. It applies to all companies within the BTG Pactual Group (“the Company”) that are required to have a modern slavery statement, and it sets out the steps taken by the Company during 2016, to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains.
Our structure and business
BTG Pactual Group is comprised of both Banco BTG Pactual and BTG Pactual Participations and its subsidiary BTG Investments. The two entities are sister entities that have the same ultimate beneficial owners. Banco BTG Pactual, its principal operating company, was founded as a small broker-dealer and has grown by creating new business units and expanding the activities within these business units. In little more than 30 years, we have built what is now a leading investment bank in Latin America, with global and established Asset Management and Commodities platforms, and expanding in Wealth Management.
Currently, the Company has approximately 3,000 employees in 22 offices on three continents (South America, North America and Europe), and provides a comprehensive range of financial services to Brazilian and global clients that include corporations, institutional investors, governments and high-networth individuals.
Our standards, policies and codes of conduct relating to slavery and human trafficking
ESG Global Policy
BTG Pactual believes in the importance of disseminating sustainability and social and environmental risk management practices throughout the company.
Our ESG Global Policy was approved by Board of Directors and reflects our long-term ambition and unconditional commitment to responsible and sustainable development. It establishes our bases, principles and guidelines and is available for all stakeholders on our institutional website.
In addition, we periodically release on our website initiatives and reports pointing out several actions we have been promoting to address modern slavery and achieve the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. 2016 ESG Report is public available on our website.

Due Diligence and steps taken
Supplier Network
As part of the extensive financial and operational due diligence carried out before the appointment of new suppliers, questions are asked about their due diligence procedures and whether the supplier has a Business Code of Conduct, including ethical principles.
Given the control framework implemented by BTG Pactual for ESG matters, we consider that the risk of modern slavery or human trafficking either in the Company or its supply chains is minimal.
Our Own Business
BTG Pactual seeks to comply with all relevant employment legislation and operates a number of policies and procedures to identify and prevent modern slavery and human trafficking within its own workforce.
In addition to being guided by the highest ethical standards and our own strict in-house compliance rules, we also:
• proactively cooperate with authorities and regulators to achieve and maintain optimal standards of risk management, respect and transparency;
• periodically review policies and procedures, and offer internal training that reflects legal and regulatory requirements;
• perform the required due diligence and monitoring (""Know Your Client"") procedures; • strive for best in industry financial practices, complying with the laws and regulations of the
various jurisdictions where BTG Pactual operates.
Evolving Approach
BTG Pactual is committed to continuing to develop the understanding of the issues and mitigating the risks involved in modern slavery. We will continually review our policies, processes and controls, and improve the mapping of our supply chain to identify areas of high risk.
During 2017 we will consider the best way to provide assurance that high risk sectors of our supply chain are free from modern slavery and we will also continue to engage and collaborate with other financial services companies as we strive to further improve standards and transparency across our supply chain.
This statement has been published pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes BTG Pactual’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2016. It has been approved by BTG Pactual’s Board of Directors and will be reviewed annually.

326,"CECP Advisors LLP Modern Slavery Act Statement
Introduction
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Modern Slavery Act”). It sets out the steps that we, CECP Advisors LLP (""CECP""), have taken to seek to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in our business and supply chains during the most recently ended financial year.
Organisation’s Structure
CECP is a UK-based affiliate of The Carlyle Group (“Carlyle”), one of the largest and most diversified multi-product global alternative asset management firms in the world, offering specialized investment funds and other investment vehicles that invest across a range of industries, geographies, asset classes and investment strategies. Carlyle operates its business through CECP and other Carlyle-affiliated investment advisers. CECP’s principal place of business is in London and it is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK. CECP provides investment advisory services to an affiliated US registered investment adviser in respect of certain Carlyle-advised funds.
Supply Chain
As an investment advisory firm, we have relatively limited supply chains. Consequently, our assessment of the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking is based on the nature of our industry and the limited extent of our supply chains. In connection with our business activities, we engage external parties to provide support services such as office cleaning and IT development suppliers. We also outsource some ancillary functions relating to our business to professional service firms, such as law firms and accountancy firms.
Measures to Address Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
Global Measures
In connection with our affiliation with Carlyle, we are subject to a number of global measures designed to address the social and governance risks related to Carlyle’s business as a global investment firm, including, for example, the risk of suppliers or business partners engaging in illegal or improper conduct. For example, such measures include the following policies and procedures:
• the Carlyle Code of Conduct, which provides Carlyle personnel with guidelines for proper business conduct;
• the Carlyle Policy on Compliance with Anticorruption and Anti-Bribery Laws, which provides Carlyle personnel with guidelines for compliance with applicable anticorruption laws; and
• the Carlyle Whistleblower Policy, which outlines ways in which individuals can report illegal or unethical behaviour.
Further, managing environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues has become integral to how Carlyle invests and conducts its business. Among other things in support of these efforts, on

an annual basis, Carlyle prepares a Corporate Citizenship Report, which discusses the firm’s ESG responsibilities and activities. A copy of this report can be accessed here.
CECP-Specific Measures
Further, we have put in place a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy (the ""MSA Policy""), which seeks to identify and manage modern slavery-related risks in our business and supply chains. In adopting this policy, we seek to accomplish the below overarching objectives:
• Continuing to develop systems to (a) identify, assess and monitor potential higher risk areas in our supply chains, (b) mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains through enhanced contract term controls (as applicable and wherever possible), (c) train our employees as to these risks and the need to manage them and (d) protect whistle blowers.
• Where possible, building long-standing relationships with our key suppliers and ensuring that expectations of business behaviour are clear and consistent.
Implementation
Our Legal & Compliance and Human Resources Teams will work together to implement the objectives considered in this statement.
Effectiveness
We will continue to monitor our compliance with this statement and our policies, in the following ways:
• training on modern slavery (see below); • implementation of the MSA Policy; • maintenance of systems for supply chain identification, including adding modern slavery
enquiries and controls to Carlyle’s vendor management and procurement policies; and • ongoing review of existing and new supply chains.
Training and Communication
As necessary, training with respect to the MSA Policy will be provided to educate on the importance of implementing and enforcing effective systems in an effort to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chain.
Ongoing Monitoring
If issues are identified in relation to modern slavery, these will be dealt with by the Legal & Compliance Team or as otherwise specified by applicable Carlyle policies and procedures.
This statement will be reviewed annually.
The Operations Division of CECP approved this statement on 30 June 2017. It has been signed by the division head and such signed copy is available upon request.

2016-17
Whistles is a contemporary fashion brand based in London. We are committed to conducting business within the spirit of ethical standards, and to having a positive impact on our stakeholders and those who work at Whistles.
Whilst we are in the early stages of our corporate social responsibility journey, we firmly believe the work we have started reflects our commitment to providing
those that work for us with dignified work and we have put human rights and higher labour standards at the centre of our programme.
The complexity of modern slavery allows it to exist in many forms and greater transparency will allow us to identify risks and prioritise how to approach the issue in the most effective way.
This transparency statement sets out some of the steps that Whistles has taken to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not present in our business operations and supply chains. It covers the financial year ending 31 March 2017 and
has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”).

Our Business Organisation and Supply Chain

Our Policies
In addition to the Whistles code of conduct, in 2016 we developed the following policies which are also relevant to the Act and which will be implemented and published 2017. They are:
The Whistles Buying Policy
The Whistles Human Rights Policy
These policies are designed to support ethical sourcing and labour standards and are based on the ILO labour standards, the UN Declaration on Human Rights, and the Guiding Principles
for Business and Human Rights.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) is aligned with the Ethical Trading Initiative (“ETI”) framework and outlines the minimum social and environmental standards we expect each factory to meet and our expectations regarding the conditions in which our products should be manufactured.
The Code of Conduct explicitly states that Whistles expects all employment to be freely chosen and working conditions to be safe and hygienic. Child labour is prohibited, living wages
are to be paid, working hours should not be excessive and workers should not be subjected to harsh or inhumane treatment.
We ask all suppliers to sign our Code of Conduct, and we ask them to obtain the same from their sub-contractors to maintain consistent labour standards across all aspects of production. The supplier is responsible for ensuring that the Code of Conduct is implemented and adhered
to by all of its approved subcontractors and business partners.
We will only do business with suppliers that share our commitment to fair and safe labour practices and who sign up to our Code of Conduct.
Our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, Equal Opportunities Policy and Whistleblowing Policy sit alongside the Code of Conduct and we expect our suppliers to implement these policies
as if they were their own.

Our Risk Assessment and Management
Whistles sees the mapping of the supply chain as an essential piece of work in managing and mitigating risks. In 2016 we carried out a supply chain mapping exercise and now have visibility of all of our first tier suppliers. We acknowledge that the supply chain is constantly moving as new suppliers are added in line with our growth and some suppliers are removed. Therefore, we plan to
review this on an annual basis and we will expand this process to encompass second-tier suppliers involved in processes such as printing, embroidery and finishing.
Factory Audits
We review our first-tier factories at source on an annual basis, either by carrying out Whistles ethical audits or third party social audits through SEDEX. As members of ETI we use a public methodology
called SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) as the basis for our audits.
All suppliers and factories undergo ethical audits and social compliance reviews prior to their engagement. Each season we review the compliance of our key suppliers with respect to the commercial and ethical criteria we set. We share our findings with our suppliers and highlight
areas which should be addressed in order to improve performance.
When issues occur, we highlight these to the Suppliers and work with them to help resolve any non-conformance in a timely manner.
Though monitoring may highlight the issues occurring at a factory level we acknowledge that in order to solve such issues we need to identify and address the root causes behind them.
Being a member of the ETI gives Whistles the opportunity to collaborate and work with other brands, organisations, NGOs and Trade Unions to identify and address the root causes that
lead to problems at factories.
The SEDEX platform enables members to report on trends across the supply chain and to liaise with one another where indications of forced or bonded labour arise so that these can be followed up.

Corporate Social Responsibility Working Committee
In 2016 we set up a Corporate Social Responsibility Working Committee comprising members from a range of departments in the organisation, including Technical & Compliance, Logistics, Buying, IT, Legal, Brand, HR and Communications. The committee meets on a monthly basis and provides us with the opportunity to explore and discuss matters of corporate responsibility at management level. The outcomes of these meeting are communicated to all appropriate
levels and areas of the business.
Training
Training on ethical buying, social compliance and factory engagement programmes was issued to the buying, design and senior management teams within Whistles’ Head Office.
This will be repeated in 2017.

Whistles Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement 2016–17

Our next steps
The next steps for us as an organisation will be:

Create remediation policies on Child labour
and Modern Slavery.

Collaboration work with external peers to effect change at factory level.

Focus on two key projects: Cotton Pledge and Turkey Syrian Crisis.

Use ETI framework on Human Rights due dilligence to support our CSR program and employment rights of
workers in Turkley.

Develop a strategy that includes clear targets for managing labour standards and human right in the supply chain, and monitors on-going progress against these
targets.

Monitor and report the number and proportion of direct suppliers that have a valid social compliance
audit from the last year, and records suppliers in full compliance with the relevant social standards.

Ensure labour standards and human rights’
training is provided to supplier’s management teams, and maintains
records of training coverage through Supplier Workshops.

Initiate and organise capacity building projects
relevant to its supply chain, and maintains learning and feedback mechanisms to ensure that the lessons learned are built into the brand activities on labour standards and human
rights.

Anti Slavery Policy Statement

About English Lakes Anti Slavery Policy Statement

Anti-slavery and human trafficking policy

Policy Statement

-

Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and

human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person's

liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.

- We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
- We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery consistent with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners.
- This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners.
- This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
Responsibility for this policy

- The board of directors has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy complies with our legal and ethical obligations, and that all those under our control comply with it.
- The board has primary responsibility for implementing this policy. Day to day monitoring, its use and effectiveness, dealing with any queries about it, and auditing internal control systems and procedures to ensure they are effective in countering modern slavery will be dealt with by the Senior Management Team.
- Management at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with this policy and are given adequate and regular training on it and the issue of modern slavery in supply chains.
- You are invited to comment on this policy and suggest ways in which it might be improved. Comments, suggestions and queries are encouraged and should be addressed, if you work within the organisation to your line manager or from

outside the organisation send in writing to English Lakes Hotels Support Office, Low Wood Bay, Windermere, Cumbria LA23 1LP, marked for the attention of the Operations Director.
Compliance with this policy
- You must ensure you read, understand and comply with this policy.
- The prevention, detection and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our business or supply chains is the responsibility of all those working for us or under our control. You are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.
- You must notify a manager as soon as possible if you believe or suspect that a conflict with this policy has occurred, or may occur in the future.
- You are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of modern slavery in any parts of our business or supply chains of any supplier tier at the earliest possible stage.
- If you work within the business and believe or suspect a breach of this policy has occurred or that it may occur you must notify your manager as soon as possible.
- If you work within the business and are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their working conditions within any tier of our supply chains constitutes any of the various forms of modern slavery, raise it with your manager.
- We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery of whatever form is or may be taking place in any part of our own business or in any of our supply chains. Detrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern. If you believe that any team member has suffered any such treatment, you should inform your line manager or a director immediately. If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should raise it formally using the Company’s Grievance Procedure.
- Any person working for our business or as a supplier or contractor to our business who is found to be engaging in slavery or human trafficking will be disciplined or the relationship terminated and will also be reported to the relevant authority.
Awareness of this policy
- The risk our business faces from modern slavery in its supply chains forms part of all our responsibility to be aware of for all individuals who work for us. All our employees should ensure they are familiar with this policy.
- We aim to communicate our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery to all suppliers, contractors and business partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and to be reinforced as appropriate thereafter.
Breaches of this policy
- Any employee who breaches this policy may face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for misconduct or gross misconduct.
- We may terminate our relationship with other individuals and organisations working on our behalf if they breach this policy.

Modern Slavery Act 2015
Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2017
We are committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking.
Headlam Group plc and its subsidiary companies (the ‘Group’) is Europe’s largest distributor of floorcoverings, linking together a global manufacturing supply base and an extensive customer base. Our scale gives our suppliers the broadest coverage with the greatest customer penetration for their products across the UK and Continental Europe, and our customers an unrivalled range of floorcoverings supported by excellent customer service and next day delivery. Our Group has over 2,400 employees based in the UK, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
We understand that the issue of slavery and human trafficking is a global issue and that no business sector will be able to eliminate or be free of slavery within their supply chain without working collaboratively within its industry. We will strive to ensure that our supply chain is free from slavery and human trafficking.
Our business
Our business is organised into business units, all of which report centrally into the parent company, Headlam Group plc, and the Group reported total revenue of £707.8 million in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2017.
Our supply chains
The Group sources an extensive range of floorcovering products including carpet, residential vinyl, engineered wood, laminate, luxury vinyl tile (‘LVT’), ceramic tiles, underlay and commercial flooring. The acquisition by Headlam Group plc of The Domus Group of Companies Limited and its subsidiaries in 2017 diversified and broadened the Group’s overall position in the floorcoverings market with entry into ceramics and an increased weighting in engineered wood, LVT and laminate. During 2017, we purchased from 119 significant suppliers based in 16 primary countries. As for 2016, in 2017 over 90% of our purchases were from suppliers in the EU.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking taking place anywhere in our supply chains or in any part of our business. This reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls.
Our actions during 2017
The Group and members of its buying team work closely with suppliers throughout the year, meeting with them on a regular basis at their manufacturing facilities and/or showrooms.
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we visit certain of our suppliers and inspect their manufacturing facilities as well as receive and review the results of our supplier’s audits. One of our business units is registered on Sedex (Social, Ethical Data Exchange) which is an online platform which allows suppliers (including certain of our suppliers) to register and provide company information/audit reports which can be viewed by their customers. Sedex includes a self-assessment questionnaire which has to be completed which includes a section on human rights. We view our registered suppliers’ responses on the online platform. Certain of our suppliers perform their own audits, the results of which are shared with us. We have visited the manufacturing facilities of some of our overseas suppliers. Where we do not visit the manufacturing facilities of certain of our larger suppliers, typically these suppliers undertake their own audits and share the results of those audits with the Group.
Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking
During 2018 we will be increasing overseas visits to better review if anti-slavery practices are being monitored, reviewed and maintained within our supply chain. Greater internal training will be given to relevant employees of the Group to help them investigate and identify slavery or human trafficking practices. Further, we will be putting in place systems to:
• Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains; • Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains; • Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains; and • Protect whistle blowers.
Supplier adherence to our values
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure all those in our supply chain and our contractors comply with our values we will look to only deal with suppliers who we consider are compliant with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and we have constituted a Group-wide dedicated compliance team, which consists of involvement from:
• The Company Secretary; • The Chief Operating Officer and management for those businesses receiving supplies from non-EU based suppliers; and • Individuals from buying, sales and procurement.
Our effectiveness in combating slavery and human trafficking
We will use the following key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) to measure how effective we have been at ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:
• During 2018 we will visit at least 50% of our suppliers based outside the EU and a significant proportion of our suppliers in the EU; • We will send a questionnaire to all non-EU based suppliers by end of Q2 2018 requiring written answers to anti-slavery and human trafficking questions by end of Q3 2018; and

• Undertake an internal audit during Q4 2018 on achievement of our aims. This updated statement was approved by the Board of Headlam Group plc and its subsidiaries in relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2017, and signed on its behalf by Steve Wilson Chief Executive
