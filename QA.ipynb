    "This is the notebook for experimenting with a Question-Answering approach to the task of classifying documents based on whether or not they give evidence that the company submitting the document has provided any training about modern slavery to their employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation is to use transfer learning from models pre-trained to extract relevant answers (as a span) from a document (context) in order to automate the identification of which small subsets of the documents might be relevant to modern slavery training. These smaller subsets can then make the job of human-labelling additional documents more efficient or be fed into another model (perhaps a transformer trained for sequence classification) which can only handle a limited number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part of this task is that many of the documents are longer than the maximum length for even the longest models (e.g. longformer @ 4096 tokens). Most documents will need to be divided up into smaller chunks and running the pre-trained QA models on each chunk, but the best way to do this isn't obvious. Some options being considered include: \n",
    "* divide up by paragraph seems to make the most sense as each paragraph should be about a single topic such as training. However, documents in the dataset were imported in various ways and there is no easy way to tell where one paragraph ends and the next one begins as often (but not always) there are line breaks in the middle of sentences where the text wrapped to the next line in the original document.\n",
    "* divide up by sentence could also be considered, but there are some sections of documents that are not written in sentence form (for example they may be in bullet form) and do not contain any periods for long chunks of text; some sentences in the dataset are longer than the max token length all by themselves\n",
    "* divide up by a fixed number of tokens is tricky because you could end up with a break in the middle of the section that talks about training and miss it altogether. If you overlap the sections, it is difficult to figure how to recombine relevant sections. Also the tokenizer loses some of the text as the tokenization process is reversed, making it difficult to compare the output to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "These options are each currently being pursued as well as looking for other possibilities. Apologies as this is currently a work in progress, it is not well documented."

      "The H&M group is one of the world’s leading fashion companies. With our brands – H&M, COS, Monki, & Other Stories, Weekday and Cheap Monday – we want to inspire fashion fans across the globe to dress their personal style. Each of our brands has its own unique identity and they are united by a passion for fashion and a drive to dress customers in a sustainable way.\n",
      "We want to make fashion sustainable and sustainability fashionable. We are dedicated to creating a better fashion future and we use our size and scale to drive development towards a more circular, fair and equal fashion industry. The H&M group brings together more than 161,400 colleagues working for six fashion brands across the world. We are dedicated to always creating the best offering for our customers and we all share a values-driven way of working, based on a fundamental respect for the individual. In 2016 we welcomed 13,400 new colleagues and we have more than 4350 stores in 64 markets. For further information about the group, its organisational structure and group relationships, view About us and Annual Report.\n",
      "OUR VALUE CHAIN When we talk about our value chain, we mean the full range of activities it takes for us to bring our products to the market – from idea to processing and manufacturing, distribution and consumption to disposal or recycling, in other words - our supply chain as well as our own operations.\n",
      "Forced labour is identified as a salient human rights issue and can potentially occur in different forms throughout the entire value chain. The risks of forced labour related to our industry is most prominent in the supply chain, often linked to specific raw materials and processes but also a potential risk connected to internal operations for example in connection to staff outsourcing. For more information about the risks and impact along our value chain, and how we address these, see our Sustainability Report 2016 on impacts along our value chain in chapter vision and strategy.\n",

      "ADDRESSING MODERN SLAVERY\n",
      "Modern slavery is a comprehensive term used in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 which covers slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour, and human trafficking1. These are violations of human rights such as the right to be free from slavery, servitude or forced labour and the right to freedom of movement and other human rights, which are upheld by both international and national legislation. According to available data and research experts, these offences are prominent and occur in all parts of the world and economies, and affect all sectors and industries2.\n",
      "We believe that a commitment to human rights and dedicated work to respect these rights must be a fundamental part of any business. This means addressing risks and impacts throughout our value chain. The risks to and impacts on human rights are often complex and difficult to manage without a collaborative approach. Therefore we are working closely with our industry peers, business partners, external human rights experts and various global and local stakeholders to increase our capability to respect and uphold human rights principles. Further, improving industrial relations is a focus of ours as we believe it allows for improved conditions when workers and employees can exercise their rights, negotiate with their employers and participate in the development of the workplace.\n",
      "OUR POLICIES AND COMMITMENTS\n",
      "H&M publicly commits to respecting human rights and recognises its responsibility to respect human rights as stated in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) through its Human Rights Policy. Our Human Rights Policy also covers modern slavery, as defined in the Modern Slavery Act 2015, as it is linked to human rights stated in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Besides our Human Rights Policy, we also have specific mandatory requirements for all our business partners, which have to sign and implement our Sustainability Commitment for Business Partners. This commitment clearly states that “forced labour, bonded, prison or illegal labour is not accepted. If contracted labour is hired, the employer is responsible for payment of employment eligibility fees of contract and/or foreign workers, including recruitment fees. Employees shall not be required to lodge “deposits” or identity papers with their employer and shall be free to leave their employment after reasonable notice. The employee’s freedom of movement is not restricted. No part of the wages is withheld”.\n",
      "H&M employees are continuously trained in our policies, including those related to human rights, and our company values. More information can be found in the H&M Way and Policies Overview. Below follows a description of how we work to implement and follow up our Human Rights Policy and our Sustainability Commitment for Business Partners.\n",

      "OUR HUMAN RIGHTS MANAGEMENT APPROACH\n",
      "Our policies and commitments guide our approach to managing human rights and our aim is to ensure that due diligence is conducted in a systematic and consistent manner. This is of great importance for fulfilling our responsibility to respect human rights in practice and act with accountability. To H&M, human rights due diligence is an ongoing process to identify, address (prevent, mitigate and/or remediate) and account for how we respect human rights in practice. Various processes – including risk management processes, business partner due diligence, stakeholder engagement and grievance handling, as well as specific internal training on our approach to human rights – contain a clear component of assessing risks to human rights, and together these serve as the basis for our human rights management.\n",
      "Our ambition: Continuously ensure human rights is an\n",
      "integral part of relevant processes\n",
      "Below, find the key processes for both our own operations and our supply chain that comprehensively integrate human rights:\n",
      " Identifying our salient human rights issues. See below for our method of defining our salient human rights issues and the process undertaken in 2015. The salient human right issues will be reviewed annually and the full process will be conducted at approximately three-year intervals, or more frequently if deemed relevant. A review of the salient human rights issues was conducted in the end of 2016.\n",
      " Annual sustainability risk assessment conducted by all business functions. All business functions assess their sustainability risks, including human rights risks, annually. The purpose is to ensure the existence and adequacy of prevention and mitigation plans. The sustainability risks are aggregated and fed into the corporate risk process.\n",
      " Potential business partner due diligence. In line with H&M’s due diligence guidelines, the legal, financial, social – including human rights – and environmental aspects of a\n",

      "\f",
      "purchase (of a product or service) are duly assessed before entering into a business relationship. Our business functions assess the relevant social and environmental risks associated with their sector and type of purchase.  Country sustainability risk assessment (including human rights and environmental issues). All new retail and production markets are thoroughly assessed before deciding to move in with H&M operations. Stakeholders (global and, when possible, local) are consulted and review our findings, give additional input and help guide us in actions to address critical issues. In addition to our global goal to assess all markets before entry, we have conducted country sustainability risk assessments for our existing production markets which are considered to be high risk from a sustainability perspective. Further, the sustainability risks related to our production countries are reviewed annually.  Supply chain management/business partner follow-up. We focus on building strong long-term relationships that are based on trust and transparency. All business partners need to comply with our Sustainability Commitment and Code of Ethics and only in exceptional cases do we agree to not have these documents signed. Production units for H&M products must meet our minimum requirements, which are ascertained through an audit prior to production. As of today our audit scope and monitoring programme covers 100% of first tier manufacturing and processing units as well as second tier component suppliers of fabric and yarn amounting to approximately 60% of production volume. Continuous follow-up of business partners’ implementation of the Sustainability Commitment is an important risk assessment tool. Since 2013 we have published our Supplier List. For all our suppliers of commercial goods (and of selected non-commercial goods such as interior, visual and marketing products) we apply our Sustainability Impact Partnership Programme (SIPP), which monitors performance on a broad range of social and environmental issues and also measures management systems within sustainability areas through the Higg Index3. This is an approach that aims beyond standard compliance and captures sustainability performance for relevant social and environmental aspects, as well as driving ownership. We are also committed to rewarding good business partner performance. Other business partners, for noncommercial goods and services, are also subject to regular follow-up of the requirements of the Sustainability Commitment, including warehouse and logistics solutions partners and store construction contractors/sites – driven by the respective business function.  Material/process/product risk assessment. We have updated our risk assessment of materials used in our products to strengthen the human rights and environmental perspective. The results of the assessment are intended to guide us in potential preventative, mitigation and remediation measures to ensure responsible sourcing of materials.  Case handling routine/process. For situations and cases with a human rights impact – that goes beyond what is covered by and dealt with through our Sustainability Commitment – we apply a systematic approach to analysing our responsibility according to the UNGPs and apply appropriate remediation measures. This analysis is integrated into our existing routine for handling cases and incidents.\n",

      "MODERN SLAVERY & FORCED LABOUR, IDENTIFIED AS SALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES\n",
      "The UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF) was launched in 2015, and suggests that a company’s disclosure of its work to address human rights is based upon reporting of its work targeting its salient human rights issues – the human rights at risk of the most severe negative impacts through the company’s operations and supply chain. As an early adopter of this framework, H&M conducted a thorough process to identify our salient human rights issues. This supplements our materiality analysis in the area of human rights with an understanding of risks to people.\n",
      "Forced labour has been identified as a salient human rights issue and takes different forms throughout the value chain. For more details on our salient human rights issues, see our Sustainability Report 2016 chapters 100% Fair & Equal, Standards & Policies and How we report. Forced labour is defined as per ILO Convention 29 as “all work or services which are exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which said person has not offered him/her voluntarily”4.\n",
      "To ensure our minimum requirements are met, including but not limited to the absence of child and forced labour, and to enable us to monitor the implementation of the requirements of our Sustainability Commitment for Business Partners, it is crucial for us to know where the production/manufacture of our products takes place. Consequently, unauthorised subcontracting to units not audited and approved by H&M is strictly forbidden; should it occur, it seriously damages our trust and business relationship and has business consequences. To ensure that our production takes place in audited and approved units, we make sure we know where each order is manufactured and, for example, the associated fabric and/or yarn mills. The latter is possible through our coverage of second tier suppliers.\n",
      "Our long-term ambition is to have full traceability for all our products throughout the value chain and to have clear goals for specific materials used in our products. Read more in our Sustainability Report 2016 chapter 100% Circular & Renewable. Supply chains are complex, however, and achieving full traceability takes time. This means we continuously need to identify all actual and potential risks to human rights in our value chain, including those of modern slavery and forced labour, and work pro-actively to prevent and mitigate these risks. Often, improving issues in the value chain requires a collaborative approach because on their own, the different actors with a stake in the issue lack the leverage to create substantial and sustainable improvements. We therefore seek to join forces with our stakeholders such as our peers, suppliers and business partners, with NGOs, trade unions and many others to improve the sustainability of our industry.

      "and human rights due diligence. The goal aims to ensure the continuance of human rights due diligence and to ensure the issues identified are appropriately addressed.  Formalised a global grievance channel to supplement local grievance mechanisms and systems already in place. This allows an added layer of communication, available to all our employees.  Joined The Mekong Club, an organisation that fights the business of modern slavery by engaging, inspiring and supporting the private sector to take the lead in this fight.  Continued to address the particular risk of Syrian refugees being exposed to exploitative labour practices due to their undocumented status and kept in close dialogue with our active suppliers in Turkey on the employment of Syrian refugees. If regulations are duly complied with, we take a positive view of working with refugees under temporary protection. H&M collaborates with ASAM (the Association of Solidarity with Asylum Seekers and Migrants) in cases where Syrian refugees are found working without required permits and in cases where a child is involved; we work with CYDD (the Association for the Support of Contemporary Living). Together with the ETI and Fair Labor Association (FLA), we sent a letter to the Turkish Government to expedite the process related to the legal framework for Syrian refugees and met with the Chief Advisor to the Prime Minister of Turkey and representatives of other relevant governmental institutions in charge of the Syrian refugee crisis. New regulations were issued on 11 January 2016.  Conducted internal training for sustainability staff at a global, production and business function (including selected retail markets) level. Representatives of our legal department and those responsible for public affairs, communication, traceability and transparency also took part in training held by the ETI Ethical Trading Initiative5 about the UK Modern Slavery Act and the risk of modern slavery along the value chain of business, as well as a gap analysis to identify improvement areas in regards to addressing modern slavery.  Actions were initiated to address the areas for improvement detected in the above-mentioned gap analysis:\n",
