    "This notebook is for visualizing the results of the sliding-window QA model approach on the Modern Slavery Dataset. The approach is run in the notebook 'QA-sliding window.ipynb'. The idea behind the approach is to use a pretrained QA model (one trained on SQuAD v2 such that it can return a \"no span found\" result) to ask questions of the documents in a zero-shot configuration. Since most documents in the dataset are longer than the maximum input length, a sliding window approach is used: after the entire document is tokenized, the QA model is run on successive windows, each slid by stride=128 tokens (~1/4th of the window size). All spans returned by the QA model are recorded in a new dataframe (df_with_segments.parquet). \n",
    "\n",
    "This viewer is used to display the spans found by the QA model to investigate whether the model is providing useful filtering. As such, it is important to be able to visualize not only the spans, but also the text that the model ignored. Therefore, the entire documents are printed and the spans that were found are highlighted. The model was run with 6 potentially useful questions. Here, each question is assigned a different color as shown in the legend below. Where multiple questions returned the same span, that span is printed multiple times, once in each color."

      "AO World plc (“AO”) fully supports the government’s objectives to eradicate modern slavery and human trafficking.\n",
      "About AO World plc\n",
      "We sell major and small domestic appliances and consumer electronics in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands and deliver them via our in-house logistics business and carefully selected third parties. We also provide ancillary services such as the installation of new and collection of old products and offer product protection plans and customer finance. Via our state of the art facility we are also able to carry out the recycling of waste appliances in the UK. We have a unique and vibrant culture and a team of people who genuinely care more about our business and its customers and currently employ over 2,800 people. For further details on the structure of our business and our Corporate Social Responsibility report please read our latest annual report and accounts.\n",
      "About our supply chain\n",
      "AO’s supply chain network covers the products we sell, the transportation and delivery of such products and our day-to-day operations.\n",
      "The electrical appliances we sell are generally purchased from local supplier subsidiaries in country which are part of larger global organisations. These relationships are managed by dedicated teams based in each of our territories. Supply chains are often complex in terms of structure with a significant number of layers.\n",
      "Our policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking\n",
      "Our anti-slavery policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships, helping to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our business. We expect all those in our supply chain to comply with this approach.\n",
      "Our due diligence during the reporting period\n",
      "Prior to entering into agreements with manufacturers (suppliers) we issue them with a compliance form which is designed to assess areas of potential risk within our supply chains and aims to ensure that manufacturer suppliers have their own clearly defined ethical working practices including suitable anti‐slavery and human trafficking policies and processes within their businesses and confirmation that they comply with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.\n",
      "Further steps\n",
      "Going forward we intend to continue to enhance our supplier due diligence process. We\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "recognise that due to the large number of supplier relationships throughout our business a risk based approach is appropriate in seeking to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our business or our supply chain.\n",
      "We have established a process to allow the Group to identify its higher risk relationships which enables us to tailor our supplier due diligence accordingly. We will continue to refine this process. To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business \u001b[6;30;41mwe will also aim to develop training for our staff, \u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[6;30;45mwe will also aim to develop training for our staff, \u001b[0mand encourage them to identify and report any potential concerns.\n",
      "We will assess any instances of non‐compliance on a case‐by‐case basis and tailor any remedial action appropriately.\n",
      "This statement is made in accordance with Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes AO World plc and its UK incorporated subsidiaries AO Retail Limited, Expert Logistics Limited and AO Deutschland Limited’s anti‐slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2018. It sets out the steps taken, and those which AO intends to take in the future to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business.\n",

      "OUR BUSINESS Zalando is a leading European online fashion platform for women, men and children serving 15 European markets. Our operating activities include development, sourcing, marketing and retail. Via our online store we sell apparel, shoes and accessories from different international brands as well as private label products. The latter are managed, sourced and sold by Zalando SE’s wholly-owned subsidiary, zLabels GmbH. zLabels goods are produced in 27 countries across the world. In 2016, we sourced our products from 278 suppliers with 464 factories. We do not own any of the production facilities. In order to sell products, Zalando has built a complex online platform, providing partners with services including IT intelligence or fulfilment. All transportation services from the countries of production to the customer as well as the return process are provided by business partners.\n",
      "Zalando’s supply chain\n",
      "The core of Zalando’s operations is conducted in Germany with a centralized team located at our headquarters in Berlin. We also have Technology Hubs in Dortmund, Hamburg, Dublin and Helsinki. Our products are globally sourced and then dispatched from our own fulfillment centers including four in Germany and an international one in Northern Italy. Two new Zalando fulfillment centers are expected to open in 2017, one in France and one in Poland. Our German fulfillment centers are operated by Zalando, whilst international ones are operated by third-party logistics service providers. Customer service is provided by Zalando teams and external service providers. Managing a global supply chain poses many challenges, especially regarding human rights, labor conditions, and the environment. We are constantly evaluating the impact of our business at each stage in the value chain in order to find the right solution for different challenges. We approach the supply chain management for third-party brands and our private labels differently. For our private labels, our level of inﬂuence is evidently higher so we engage directly with our suppliers in the sourcing countries and will share our approach in more detail in this document. When it comes to our third-party brands and other service providers, we also recognize the responsibility we share to improve the conditions in the value chain. We define minimum standards for all our partners on topics such as human rights and labor practices in our Code of Conduct for Business Partners.\n",
      "page 1 / 3 MODERN SLAVERY ACT STATEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "OUR POLICIES Human trafficking and forced labor is a violation of human rights. Zalando does not tolerate modern slavery in its operations nor in its supply chain.\n",
      "Our commitment to avoid human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain is underpinned in our Code of Conduct for Business Partners. The Code was established in 2013 and is overseen by Zalando’s Management Board. It applies to various business partners group-wide, including but not limited to vendors, suppliers, agents, trading companies and service providers. The Code was revised in 2016 and is publicly available on our website.\n",
      "The Code of Conduct expressly prohibits the use of forced, bonded, indentured and prison labor, as well as the slavery or trafficking of persons in any form. Supply chain job seekers shall not be compelled to work through force, deception, intimidation, or coercion. \u001b[6;30;44mAll work shall be voluntary, \u001b[0mand workers shall be free to terminate their employment upon reasonable notice without penalty. Additionally, holding, confiscating or destroying original worker identification documents, passports, travel papers or other personal documents is prohibited.\n",
      "Ensuring good working conditions in our fulfillment centers is a priority for Zalando. Since 2012 we have processes in place to closely monitor the social standards at both our own and partner fulfillment centers. The implementation and maintenance of the social standards are reviewed on a regular basis both internally and externally by the independent testing and certification company, DEKRA. DEKRA checks take place on an unannounced basis approximately twice a year. These checks cover, among other topics, that no forced labour is taking place and that working hours do not exceed the legal regulations.\n",
      "At zLabels GmbH we have a robust Ethical Trading program in place. As part of our onboarding process, all new suppliers and factories must sign up to the Zalando Code of Conduct for Business Partners. In addition, \u001b[6;30;41mall factories must provide a recent audit done by an accredited, external third-party. \u001b[0mBased on the findings of the audit, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is developed and we ask our suppliers and their factories to demonstrate improvement in all identified areas. No orders can be placed without setting up a factory on our system and this is only done if it meets all our ethical requirements as laid down in our Code of Conduct.\n",
      "For a new factory setup, if critical findings are observed, we do not begin the relationship without evidence that the existing findings have been remediated. If a critical non-compliance (NC) is found at an existing factory, we require evidence of improvement to continue our business relationship. We work with nominated third-party consultants who provide external support on resolving NCs at our suppliers’ factories. In addition to our third party audit program, the zLabels Ethical Trade team also visits approximately 10% of all strategic factories annually to ensure our Code of Conduct is being followed.\n",
      "We have an ethical database that connects various parts of our business to factory ethical information. On the database, suppliers can manage their factories, audits and CAPs. This system was put in place to increase transparency of our process with suppliers and also within other parts of the zLabels business. This new system allows us to easily track each factory’s progress and provides reminders to suppliers and their factories on uploading evidence and CAP closures.\n",
      "We carry out business partner due diligence for all partners of an entity of the Zalando group which are associated with a potential higher risk according to our Group Policy “Compliance Checks on Business Partners”.\n",

      "\n",
      "\f",
      "RISK MANAGEMENT All areas of our business, including logistics, HR, technology, operations and procurement, have been risk-mapped. Zalando has a group-wide centralized Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, which comprises the Risk Management and the Compliance Management. It closely collaborates with the Internal Audit team, the Legal teams (Commercial Law and Corporate Legal) and the Corporate Responsibility team. All aforementioned teams are headed by the General Counsel. The Governance, Risk & Compliance function carries out regular risk workshops with key stakeholders in the Zalando group and Internal Audit carries out regular audits on processes in different functions. The GRC function and the Ethical Trade function are also subject to internal audits. Furthermore, the Supplier Management function was audited in 2015, and the agreed follow-up measures were reviewed by the Internal Audit function in 2016. zLabels GmbH has a dedicated Ethical Trade team to oversee risks and countermeasures regarding the supply chain for our own private labels. The team has completed a mapping exercise of zLabels’ apparel and footwear supply chain and identified high risk geographical areas. We have developed a new categorization of our high risk countries and identified programs or additional requirements for all new factories in these countries.\n",

      "U.K. MODERN SLAVERY ACT STATEMENT\n",
      "U.K. MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT FOR FISCAL 2017\n",
      "This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the U.K. Modern Slavery Act and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and outlines the efforts L Brands has taken and is continuing to take to ensure that forced labor is not occurring within our supply chain.\n",
      "Forced labor includes prison, indentured, bonded, involuntary or slave labor or labor obtained through human trafficking. L Brands has a zero-tolerance policy regarding forced labor. We are committed to operating ethically and with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to putting effective systems and controls in place to safeguard against any form of forced labor taking place within our supply chain.\n",
      "OUR BUSINESS\n",
      "More than stores, more than products ... L Brands is a family of brands. Our brands are world-renowned; they are household names. Through Victoria's Secret, PINK, Bath & Body Works, La Senza and Henri Bendel, L Brands is an international company that sells lingerie, personal care and beauty products, apparel and accessories. The company operates company-owned specialty stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Greater China, and its brands are sold in franchised locations worldwide.\n",
      "We are committed to providing superior quality merchandise and services to customers. As part of our corporate culture and values, we strongly believe the quality of our merchandise begins with the treatment of the people who create our products. L Brands only partners with suppliers that share our values and our commitment to ethical and responsible business practices.\n",
      "Through Mast Global, L Brands' supply chain organization with more than 40 years of production, sourcing and logistics experience, the company sources goods from approximately 350 factories around the world — the vast majority of which are produced in the United States, China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and India. Suppliers are selected based on their ability and commitment to meet our safety and quality standards, as well as follow our strict ethical, labor and environmental standards.\n",
      "COMMITMENT AND GOVERNANCE\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "L Brands is fully committed to ensuring our products are ethically sourced. This commitment starts with our executive leadership team and cascades throughout our organization.\n",
      "Sourcing Risk Council\n",
      "L Brands has a Sourcing Risk Council comprised of senior executives from various company divisions and functions that meets at least quarterly to discuss core business, sourcing and purchasing practices and assess current risks, including geopolitical, social compliance and associated supply risks. The Sourcing Risk Council operates under the guidance and oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Sourcing Risk Council reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis, and the Audit Committee reports periodically on these issues to the full Board of Directors.\n",
      "OUR POLICIES\n",
      "L Brands has several policies in place which have been developed by the Sourcing Risk Council to ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical manner and forced labor is not in our supply chain. These include:\n",
      "1. Supplier Code of Conduct\n",
      "To ensure that our expectations are clear, our standards are specifically outlined in our L Brands Supplier Code of Conduct. These standards and all relevant laws, regulations and conventions in all countries in which the supplier and factory operate must be adhered to and must be communicated to all workers and posted prominently in the workplace in English and the native languages of factory employees who work with our products.\n",
      "Compliance with the Law Compliance with all laws, rules and regulations.\n",
      "Minimum Wages and Benefits Payment to workers of the minimum wage prescribed by local law or the prevailing local industry wage, whichever is higher; provision to workers of benefits that conform to the better of applicable local law or prevailing local industry standards; and payment to workers of overtime compensation in compliance with all applicable laws.\n",
      "Maximum Working Hours Overtime shall be limited to a level consistent with humane and productive working conditions. Workers shall not be required, on a regularly scheduled basis, to work in excess of 60 hours (or lower if prescribed by local laws or local industry standards) per week; and, generally, workers shall be provided with at least one day off in seven.\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;41mNo Forced Labor Prison, indentured, bonded, involuntary or slave labor or labor obtained through human trafficking shall not be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;44mNo Forced Labor Prison, indentured, bonded, involuntary or slave labor or labor obtained through human trafficking shall not be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "\u001b[0mNo Child Labor All workers shall be at least the local minimum legal working age or ILO standard, whichever is higher.\n",
      "Health and Safety The work environment shall be safe and healthy.\n",
      "Nondiscrimination Workers shall be selected only on the basis of their ability to do the job and not on the basis of other personal characteristics or beliefs.\n",
      "No Corporal Punishment Neither corporal punishment nor any other form of physical or psychological coercion shall be used against workers.\n",
      "Freedom of Association The lawful exercise of workers' rights of free association shall be respected and not restricted or interfered in, and workers lawfully exercising those rights shall not be threatened or penalized.\n",
      "Environment Suppliers must comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.\n",
      "Community Involvement Projects undertaken in partnership with community groups, or local or international non-governmental organizations, particularly those that address educational opportunities for younger people employed in production facilities, shall be encouraged and supported.\n",
      "Access For the purpose of monitoring compliance with our policies, the company, subcontractors and its agents shall be given unrestricted access to all production facilities and dormitories and to all relevant records, whether or not notice is provided in advance.\n",
      "Subcontracting L Brands requires all suppliers and subcontractors to fully comply with its Code of Conduct. L Brands does not allow unauthorized subcontracting. A formal request must be submitted to L Brands for approval, should a supplier require subcontracting.\n",
      "Anti-Corruption/Anti-Bribery Suppliers must comply with all applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, rules and regulations.\n",
      "2. Sourcing Country Policy\n",
      "L Brands will not source product from any country prohibited or restricted by law as sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In addition, some countries with potential geo-political or social risks may pose a risk to our supply chain and, as a result, require pre-approval from L Brands executive leadership\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "with compliance oversight.\n",
      "Any associate who violates this policy is subject to disciplinary action, including, but not limited to, termination of employment.\n",
      "3. Foreign Migrant Worker Policy\n",
      "The L Brands Supplier Code of Conduct clearly states that prison, indentured, bonded, involuntary or slave labor or labor obtained through human trafficking shall not be used. Experts report that foreign migrant workers who travel across country borders to obtain employment are most at risk for human trafficking and forced labor, and, therefore, we have established a policy to ensure that we minimize any risk of human trafficking or forced labor in our supply chain. The policy includes an executive approval process to use a factory that employs foreign migrant workers contingent on positive results found during a specialized audit developed in accordance with the International Labour Organization’s handbook on Combatting Forced Labour. Factories that employ foreign migrant workers are closely monitored to ensure there are no forced labor violations and that workers have freedom of movement and are treated in accordance with the law.\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;41mAny associate who contracts a factory that uses foreign migrant workers without executive approval is subject to disciplinary action, \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;44mAny associate who contracts a factory that uses foreign migrant workers without executive approval is subject to disciplinary action, \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;45mAny associate who contracts a factory that uses foreign migrant workers without executive approval is subject to disciplinary action, \u001b[0mincluding, but not limited to, termination of employment.\n",
      "4. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan Cotton Policy\n",
      "L Brands is committed to ensuring that forced labor of any kind is not used in the manufacturing of our products. Because of the reports documenting the systemic use of forced labor (including the worst forms of child labor) in the harvest of cotton in both Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, we have adopted a policy to prohibit the sourcing of Uzbek and Turkmen cotton for the manufacturing of any of our products until their respective governments end the practice of forced labor, including child labor, in the cotton sector. Until the elimination of these practices is independently verified, we will maintain this commitment and will collaborate with other stakeholders to raise awareness of this very serious concern and advocate for its elimination.\n",
      "5. Conflict Minerals Policy\n",
      "L Brands prohibits its suppliers from using conflict minerals which may directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its adjoining countries in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Conflict Minerals Provisions. Form SD and Conflict Minerals Reports previously filed by L Brands can be viewed as part of our SEC filings.\n",
      "6. Independent Production Services (IPS*) Compliance Guidebook\n",
      "The IPS Compliance Guidebook is a collection of policies our suppliers are expected and legally obligated to comply with. The purpose of the IPS Compliance Guidebook is to provide additional clarification to supplier partners\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "and their factories regarding a broad range of compliance standards and requirements that we are committed to as an enterprise and also expect our suppliers to follow. Included in the IPS Compliance Guidebook are the L Brands Supplier Code of Conduct, compliance standards related to forced labor and human trafficking, the Uzbek and Turkmen cotton policy and the conflict minerals policy, among others.\n",
      "*Independent Production Services (IPS) is a function within L Brands that works with suppliers to ensure goods are sourced from factories that meet or exceed L Brands compliance standards.\n",
      "CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\n",
      "L Brands suppliers are required to sign a Master Sourcing Agreement that explicitly states that the supplier and their factories will comply with all applicable laws and L Brands policies, including each of the policies listed above.\n",
      "RISK ASSESSMENT\n",
      "We recognize that there are elevated risks of human trafficking and forced labor in certain countries, factories and product categories. Therefore, a risk assessment is conducted for new suppliers and factories to prevent involvement in high-risk business ventures. We use resources such as the annual U.S. State Department’s Trafficking in Persons report and the U.S. Department of Labor’s reports on international child labor and forced labor to determine countries and product categories with heightened risks of human trafficking and forced labor.\n",
      "L Brands also uses audits to assess risk. New factories are audited and approved by IPS before they begin L Brands production.\n",
      "DUE DILIGENCE\n",
      "To ensure compliance with our standards, we have implemented an internal audit process and are committed to providing our suppliers opportunities for learning and development. To identify and evaluate the potential risks of human trafficking, slavery or violations of other local labor standards and/or those that may be unique to L Brands and our business, we conduct our own ongoing, internal verification of our supply chain. The resulting information helps to ensure that our suppliers are in compliance with L Brands’ Supplier Code of Conduct.\n",
      "Monitoring\n",
      "IPS is a function within L Brands that works with suppliers to ensure goods are sourced from factories that meet or exceed L Brands compliance standards. IPS has been supporting global compliance for more than two decades, enabling improvement in labor standards and workplace conditions, supply chain security, trade compliance and brand protection in our supply chain through monitoring, remediation, capacity building and training.\n",
      "Our list of qualified suppliers is established and maintained in accordance with specific qualification standards and protocols developed by IPS. A list of tier 1 factories\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "approved for apparel and intimate apparel production can be found here.\n",
      "Once a supplier has passed the risk assessment, the relationship with L Brands begins with a written Master Sourcing Agreement wherein the supplier certifies that its factories and any that it may contract with will strictly adhere to L Brands' Supplier Code of Conduct, including those provisions pertaining to slavery and human trafficking.\n",
      "Each supplier must agree to allow L Brands, or an independent third party hired by L Brands, to conduct an audit of the supplier's business without prior notice. IPS or a third-party auditing firm conducts announced or unannounced audits of each of our approved factories at least annually to ensure compliance. The company may conduct more frequent reviews of factories located in countries designated as high-risk by the U.S. State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report or identified through the company’s annual risk assessment process. Certain exemptions from annual audits may be granted to factories with a record of consistent and rigorous compliance.\n",
      "These audits cover all areas of the L Brands Code of Conduct, including the No Forced Labor code, which states “prison, indentured, bonded, involuntary or slave labor or labor obtained through human trafficking shall not be used.” The International Labour Organization’s Guiding Principles to Combat Forced Labor were used to develop the L Brands applicable standards.\n",
      "A specialized assessment is conducted for factories that employ foreign migrant workers as experts believe those workers are most at risk of forced labor and human trafficking.\n",
      "All factories are required to have a grievance mechanism for workers to file questions or complaints without fear of punishment or reprisal. The factory must adequately demonstrate that a system is available and workers’ complaints are responded to and recorded.\n",
      "All audited factories are assigned a risk level, and additional follow-up actions are taken according to the level of risk.\n",
      "Remediation\n",
      "When audits are completed, an email notification is sent to the supplier to alert them that the audit report is available and corrective action may be required. It is the supplier’s responsibility to submit all corrective action plans within 30 days. All corrective actions are expected to be completed in 90 days. All corrective action plans must include supporting evidence including photos, policies, supporting documentation to demonstrate implementation of those policies, etc. If a factory does not cooperate with L Brands to make improvements, L Brands has an escalation process in place which includes a warning letter, reduction of business and ultimately loss of business if they do not take appropriate action to remediate to meet our standards.\n",
      "L Brands sources from a few hundred suppliers and factories. During fiscal 2017, more than 15,000 audit findings were evaluated across our supplier base through our\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "standard auditing process, which includes a rating protocol where critical questions are weighted higher. Approximately 11 percent of these findings required corrective action, representing a four percent decrease from fiscal 2016.\n",
      "ACCOUNTABILITY\n",
      "L Brands maintains policies and procedures that govern the consequences of noncompliance by associates and suppliers with L Brands’ sourcing and labor standards. L Brands aligns only with suppliers that share our values and our commitment to ethical and responsible business practices. To ensure that our expectations are clear, our standards are specifically outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n",
      "In addition, the IPS Compliance Guidebook is provided to all suppliers and factories. The purpose of the Guidebook is to provide additional clarification to supplier partners and their factories regarding a broad range of compliance standards and requirements, as well as actions for noncompliance that may include termination of business. If we find our supplier is not in compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct, we will require corrective action as set forth above.\n",
      "L Brands will not partner with suppliers and factories that are unwilling or unable to work with us to achieve our compliance standards. L Brands also has an Associate Code of Conduct and Guide that outlines our standards and expectations and addresses the consequences of noncompliance.\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;45mTRAINING\n",
      "As L Brands continues to foster strategic relationships with suppliers, \u001b[0mwe maintain a commitment to supplier education. For suppliers, factory management and associates who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, we host annual awareness and training sessions on all compliance standards in multiple countries around the world. The training includes human trafficking and forced labor awareness as well as steps to take to mitigate that risk within the supply chain of our products.\n",
      "In addition, we use one‐on‐one training in conjunction with compliance reviews and corrective action plans to continuously educate our factories on the prevention of human trafficking and forced labor, and to reinforce our Supplier Code of Conduct which explicitly states “prison, indentured, bonded, involuntary or slave labor or labor obtained through human trafficking shall not be used.”\n",

      "About Our Sourcing and Labor: Building Capacity\n",
      "We have been actively engaged in the development of initiatives and best practices that enhance the capacity of local governments to improve legal compliance and the capacity of our suppliers to comply with the L Brands Supplier Code of Conduct. We have undertaken these initiatives in collaboration or consultation with other leading companies, non-governmental organizations, labor groups, international organizations and multi-stakeholder initiatives.\n",
      "Collaborating With Non-Governmental Organizations\n",
      "Additionally, we seek active and constructive engagement and cooperation with labor groups and non-governmental organizations focused on solving problems that may arise at our suppliers’ facilities. Through these efforts, we strive to develop effective and sustainable models for addressing challenges throughout our supply chain.\n",
      "L Brands engages with a broad range of non-governmental organizations, labor unions, academics and other stakeholders to obtain perspectives and information necessary to manage risk in the countries from which we source. L Brands’ engagement includes participation with the Business Council for Global Development (BCGD). BCGD is a coalition of global businesses dedicated to advancing sustainable economic development and the rule of law through capacity building and a rules-based system for global trade and investment.\n",
      "Some of these stakeholders help us to manage risk through programs that enhance the rule of law (through training and capacity building) and other collaborative activities.\n",
      "EFFECTIVENESS\n",
      "L Brands’ Supplier Code of Conduct, our Ethics Hotline, training and the compliance standards listed in this statement help to prevent the use of forced labor in our supply chain. Our Master Sourcing Agreement, IPS Compliance Guidebook, due diligence, monitoring, remediation and training ensure that our suppliers are aware of our policies and implement our standards in their processes to minimize the risk of forced labor. We ask our suppliers to continuously make improvements in their compliance performance and educate their factories and subcontractors further up the supply chain. L Brands is also committed to continuously make improvements in our own compliance standards. If we find deficiencies or gain new insights, we update our policies and training to ensure we are in compliance with all applicable laws and reflect lessons learned and alignment with industry best practices.\n",
      "COMMITMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENT\n",
      "In 2018 and 2019, L Brands plans to take the following actions to improve our efforts to\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "eliminate human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. We caution that any forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change;\n",
      "L Brands continues to increase our focus on traceability throughout the supply chain, beyond tier 1 suppliers. We are updating our online forced labor and human trafficking awareness training for associates and will re-launch in 2018. We will also extend training and awareness further up the supply chain. L Brands will continue working to ensure that factories producing for us do not charge recruitment fees to workers, force workers to work in order to repay an incurred or inherited debt or use irregular, delayed, deferred or non-payment of wages as a means to bind workers to employment. We will require suppliers to read and certify compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, specifically highlighting our No Forced Labor Policy. We plan to collaborate further with industry peers, non-governmental organizations and trade unions to address systemic issues at the root of forced labor.\n",

      "\n",
      "PRIME MINISTER FOREWORD\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the world, something in the region of 40 million innocent men, women and even children have been forced into various forms of modern slavery.\n",
      "Many are here in the UK. Still more are abroad. All are victims of a vile business that has no place in the last century, let alone this one.\n",
      "Those behind such crimes, these traders in human misery, must and will be ruthlessly hunted down and brought to justice.\n",
      "And, while that happens, we should absolutely not be lining their pockets with British taxpayers’ money.\n",
      "That may sound like a statement of the blindingly obvious.\n",
      "But with complex and often opaque modern-day supply chains and subcontracts stretching, tentacle-like, not just across the country but around the world, it is all too easy for the unscrupulous and the exploitative to take a share of the £50 billion that central government spends on goods and services each year.\n",
      "That’s why it’s not enough for governments and businesses to simply say they don’t tolerate modern slavery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course they don’t – more than 230 years after Wilberforce dragged the horrors of the Atlantic slave trade firmly before the British public, no-one with even a shred of moral decency would condone the kind of barbaric practices we see everywhere from subSaharan sweatshops to your local nail bar.\n",
      "But if we are serious about tackling this increasingly pervasive evil then words alone are not enough – we have to take active steps to drive it out of our supply chains. And then we have to go out, look under the bonnet, peer into the shadows and satisfy ourselves that we have succeeded in doing so.\n",
      "That is what this statement is all about. Matching words with actions. Showing the British people what we are doing to tackle slavery, exploitation and trafficking and letting them suggest where we could do more. And, I hope, setting an example that will be followed by governments and businesses right around the world.\n",
      "As a government we don’t have to produce this statement. But we want to. Because the brutal truth is that modern slavery will endure only as long as it is profitable for the criminals – and it will only remain profitable as long as businesses and governments are prepared to look the other way.\n",
      "In 2020, for millions of people around the world the price of liberty remains eternal vigilance. And, as this statement shows, the UK government continues to lead the way in providing just that.\n",

      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern slavery is so pervasive that it is likely to exist in the supply chains of the goods and services purchased by governments across the globe, from the technology we buy to the construction projects we fund. All governments have a responsibility to ensure taxpayers’ money does not inadvertently fund criminal activity and to protect vulnerable workers in their supply chains from exploitation.\n",
      "This statement explains the steps that the UK government took in 2019 to identify, prevent and mitigate modern slavery in our operations and supply chains.1 Ministerial government departments will publish their own modern slavery statements annually, starting from financial year 2020/21. These first individual departmental statements will be published by 30 September 2021.2\n",
      "The potential for change is huge: public procurement represents a significant share of the global economy, accounting for 15% – 20% of global GDP.3 We want this statement to encourage other governments and public bodies to leverage their spending power to help realise United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7 to eradicate forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking by 2030.\n",

      "\u001b[6;30;44mFinding and acting on modern slavery in our supply chains is a huge challenge which requires sustained effort over time. \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;45mFinding and acting on modern slavery in our supply chains is a huge challenge which requires sustained effort over time. \u001b[0mWe have tens of thousands of suppliers, many of whom have complex global supply chains where effective oversight is difficult to achieve, especially in lower tiers of subcontracting. This statement describes the steps we have taken to assess where the risks are highest across government, where we have greatest leverage, and where we want to prioritise action.\n",
      "In September 2019, we published guidance setting out the steps that all ministerial government departments4 must take to identify and mitigate modern slavery risks throughout the commercial life cycle, from defining contract requirements and procuring goods to managing supplier relationships and ensuring remediation where exploitation has been uncovered.\n",
      "ICT hardware and electronics, construction and service staff (e.g. cleaning and catering) are the areas modern slavery risks are highest for most ministerial departments. We are piloting innovative programmes and taking steps to tackle the root cause of worker vulnerability in these areas.\n",

      "• We spent around £6.5 billion on ICT (including services and software) in 2018/19.\n",
      "• Our ICT supply chains include commodities and services that are critical to government operations and services, from printers and laptops to computer software.\n",
      "• Our procurement of ICT hardware is complex as it covers a large number of commodities that we may buy directly or indirectly, in bulk or in small quantities, from a range of vendors depending on business needs.\n",
      "• We have limited visibility of our ICT supply chains. This is partly due to the multiple levels of sub-contracting for the raw material extraction, component manufacturing, assembly and logistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "• We are increasing visibility of our ICT supply chains. CCS is mapping (to factory level) purchases of the top 200 products covering 58 manufacturers. This will help us work with suppliers to improve conditions on the ground.\n",
      "• We are working with Electronics Watch, an independent monitoring organisation, which brings together public buyers with in-country civil society experts to conduct and share worker-driven factory-level audits and remediate issues identified in collaboration with brands and the Responsible Business Alliance.

These cases include debt bondage, withholding of identity documents and excessive overtime. We are also aware of risks in the sourcing of key ICT commodities, such as cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n",

      "• We are working with several multistakeholder initiatives to improve transparency and governance in the mining sector in DRC. For example, \u001b[6;30;44mwe are funding the Effective Approaches to Ending the Worst Forms of Child Labour in Fragile Contexts (EAPEC) programme, \u001b[0mwhich brings together a consortium of NGOs, local partners, private sector and media development agencies to develop innovative approaches to ending child labour, including tackling the supply and demand issues which result in child labour in fragile states.\n",

      "• Foreign migrant workers in our UK construction projects may be more vulnerable to debt bondage, through exploitative recruitment fees or fraudulent online recruitment.\n",
      "• We are also aware of risks in the sourcing and processing of key commodities for construction, such as timber and bricks from a range of countries.30\n",

      "What are we doing about it?\n",
      "• We are improving our purchasing practices to reduce structural problems in the industry that increase the risk of exploitation:\n",

      "• We ask bidders to explain any prices/ costs which appear abnormally low in line with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.31\n",
      "• We are working with industry to improve standards and share intelligence with government. The Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority has launched the Construction Protocol, an agreement between government and construction companies (including many government suppliers) to work together to share intelligence on suspected worker exploitation and to improve practice. \u001b[6;30;41mThe Protocol has over 140 signatories, is free to join and is open to suppliers, subcontractors, labour agencies, SMEs and clients\u001b[0m. 72% of signatories surveyed have made improvements to their due diligence.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "As a company that carries out a portion of its business in the United Kingdom, Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated and its subsidiaries (“JLL”) approves and issues this Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement under Section 54(1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA). JLL carries on business in the UK through its UK based affiliates, including Jones Lang LaSalle Limited and LaSalle Investment Management, but our responsibilities and commitment to uphold the principles of the Modern Slavery Act extends across all of our operations.\n",
      "As one of the world’s leading professional services firms, JLL is committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards and to engaging in practices that enhance the welfare, safety, and well-being of our employees and wider communities. JLL respects and supports human rights principles as defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2009. JLL works to ensure that we do not violate these human rights principles through our business operations and activities.\n",
      "Our commitment to human rights extends to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to preventing modern slavery from occurring anywhere in our supply chain. We therefore expect all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners to embrace JLL’s Core Values of Teamwork, Ethics and Excellence. Our contracting processes highlight and reinforce JLL’s strong commitment to ethical behavior by including specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labor, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children. Further, we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.\n",
      "As a global company, we recognize the many challenges in managing and monitoring a complex supply chain. We continue to review our approach to human rights and modern slavery issues within our business and our supply chains and believe that we have identified some important focus areas and initiatives to build on in the future.\n",

      "JLL is a Fortune 500 professional services and investment management firm specializing in real estate. We offer integrated services worldwide to clients seeking increased value by owning, occupying, developing, or investing in real estate. Globally, JLL’s 77,000 employees serve clients in more than 80 countries, and we are an industry leader in property and corporate facility management services. In FY 2016, JLL’s consolidated revenue exceeded $6.8 billion.\n",
      "JLL’s human rights and anti-slavery program forms part of Building a Better Tomorrow, our sustainability leadership agenda. Building a Better Tomorrow is about creating spaces, buildings and cities where everyone can thrive. By thinking and acting sustainably we strive to do just that for our employees, clients, shareholders and communities.\n",
      "JLL has been recognized by Ethisphere for ten consecutive years as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies. The company has achieved a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, and has been named to CR Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens.\n",
      "A list of JLL’s offices appears on pages 14 and 15 in our Annual Report. Our services and operations span three geographic business segments: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. Within this vast global network, JLL’s activities range from those having relatively low risk with regard to modern slavery, such as within LaSalle Investment Management, and activities that present more risk. For example, JLL procures a significant amount of goods and services on behalf of our clients, whose properties we manage. Among these business partners are suppliers in sectors identified as higher risk for modern slavery practices: construction, janitorial, landscaping and ground maintenance, food and drink, and security services. In general, JLL’s policies and procedures are designed to identify unethical business partners before we engage them and to monitor our suppliers to make sure they maintain ethical standards that match JLL’s.\n",

      "Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking\n",
      "\n",
      "JLL has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we are committed to strengthening and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in our supply chain. We also are committed to ensuring compliance with any applicable modern slavery laws, including the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015.\n",
      "Our policy on slavery and human trafficking is part of our corporate Code of Business Ethics as well as our Vendor Code of Conduct, both of which have been published in multiple languages on our public website. These documents set forth our zerotolerance policy, and explicitly forbid child labor, human trafficking, debt bondage, forced or slave labor of any kind, inhumane conditions, substandard wages, and physical abuse or discipline. In addition, the Codes provide options for reporting violations or potential violations which are available to\n",
      "\n",
      "employees and to our suppliers, such as calling JLL’s Global Ethics Helpline or using JLL’s ethics reports website, contacting one of JLL’s Ethics Officers, or sending a letter to JLL’s Global General Counsel and Chief Ethics Officer.\n",
      "JLL also has a Corporate Governance Policy devoted to Vendor Due Diligence Guidelines that prohibits doing business with suppliers engaging in illegal practices or any questionable practices that may result in credit, reputation, or litigation issues for JLL.\n",
      "We are in the process of implementing a separate corporate governance policy addressing Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking. This policy will apply to all JLL employees and to suppliers and other third-party business associates worldwide. It identifies specific prohibited activities, and includes mechanisms for employees to report violations or potential violations of the policy.\n",

      "As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, JLL is doing the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "■ Building a global procurement policy and risk management framework to incorporate Modern Slavery Act (MSA) compliance as we prequalify and monitor our suppliers over time. Currently, JLL performs due diligence for modern slavery using a risk-based approach, typically for suppliers servicing the Corporate Solutions business, which is the business most likely to engage third parties in high-risk sectors. Increasingly throughout our global operations, these suppliers must attest in a pre-engagement questionnaire and in their contract with JLL that they do not engage in any of the activities comprising modern slavery, and must renew that attestation annually. It is expected that the policy and risk management framework in due course will help us to expand our Vendor Due Diligence and Compliance Program globally through a technology platform that allows realtime communication and information sharing between suppliers, JLL’s third-party independent compliance administrator, JLL’s internal sourcing experts, and our individual client account teams.\n",
      "■ Requiring our suppliers to comply with all applicable modern slavery and labour laws and to comply with our own Vendor Code of Conduct, which sets forth explicitly JLL’s expectation that suppliers will act in accordance with human rights principles in employment and provides mechanisms for suppliers to report suspicions or incidents of breach, including through our \u001b[6;30;41mEthics Helpline which is available on a 24 hour basis in all major languages\u001b[0m.\n",
      "■ Strengthening the ethics clause of our EMEA vendor contract templates by including a warranty specifically referring to the principles of the MSA.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ Enhancing our Global Vendor Onboarding Initiative by building additional due diligence steps into JLL’s procurement process, including, for example, subscribing to EcoVadis’s Corporate Social Responsibility database.\n",
      "■ Incorporating into our due diligence technology platform data from Walk Free Foundation’s Global Slavery Index to help us identify high-risk geographies and sectors within our supply chain. We are working in collaboration with the Walk Free Foundation to identify ways to raise awareness of modern slavery and best practices in our procurement and audit functions and at all levels of our supply chains, particularly in service lines and countries that present a greater risk of modern slavery.\n",
      "■ Incorporating MSA questions into JLL’s Global Internal Audit Vendor Questionnaire, and working with our Internal Audit Group to develop audit procedures designed to identify potential non-compliance by suppliers.\n",
      "■ Adopting the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition’s Code, which incorporates labor standards prohibiting modern slavery and human trafficking, enterprise wide.\n",
      "■ Developing an MSA Risk Assessment to examine all business lines for risk of modern slavery.\n",
      "■ Strengthening our Global Human Resources policies to ensure we have adequate internal procedures to uphold fair labor practices.\n",
      "■ Encouraging our businesses, through our Vendor Due Diligence Policy, to work with enterprises that share JLL’s values, and to develop and maintain supplier relationships that are consistent with protecting JLL’s overall interests.\n",

In providing real estate services, JLL may engage suppliers in some sectors in which modern slavery is prevalent, including construction, janitorial, landscaping and ground maintenance, hospitality, and security services. JLL assesses and manages these risks through its zero-tolerance policy and the due-diligence processes identified above.\n",

Through our ability to audit suppliers for contractual and legal compliance, we can investigate changed circumstances or suspected noncompliance. Although we are not aware of noncompliance situations in the past or in our current supply chain, we recognize that our current approach may not be effective in all cases. Accordingly, we are committed to a journey of continued improvement.\n",
      "Internally, JLL focuses on its extensive global “Ethics Everywhere” program to foster a culture of ethical behavior that encompasses awareness of and adherence to basic human rights principles. \u001b[6;30;41mWe are working towards incorporating specific anti-slavery and anti-human-trafficking content into our ethics training for \u001b[0m\n",

      "DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS\n",
      "Bechtel has taken several steps to identify, assess, and mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain, including the following:\n",
      "1. We set clear expectations for our suppliers that Bechtel does not tolerate the use of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labor or human trafficking, as set forth in Bechtel's Code of Conduct. We expect our suppliers to meet these expectations. Bechtel's supplier portal (supplier.bechtel.com) clearly communicates Bechtel's expectations.\n",
      "2. Bechtel's standard terms and conditions with suppliers and subcontractors that we consider have a moderate to high risk modern slavery exposure, include our expectations that no human trafficking or slavery is used anywhere in the supplier/subcontractor's business or by any of the suppliers/subcontractors in its own supply chain. Our suppliers/subcontractors agree to comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations. We have the right to terminate a contract with a supplier/subcontractor for breach of our terms and conditions.\n",
      "3. In 2017, Bechtel added a section into the quality surveillance checklist of its supplier facilities to be vigilant and report any signs of underage workers, involuntary labor, worker abuse and note the presence of a grievance mechanism in connection to forced labor and human trafficking. In 2018, Bechtel obtained a third-party audit report of workplace conditions covering key suppliers. The workplace conditions assessment was implemented at select sites which were deeme d highest risk across our supply chain and the results did not uncover any indications of modern slavery.\n",
      "4. In 2018, Bechtel updated its standard terms and conditions of contract with staff agencies employed in the United Kingdom to include that Bechtel does not tolerate slavery or human trafficking in the performance of Bechtel contracts and imposes a commitment from the agency to adhere to these standards and flow down the requirement to third party agency contracts.\n",
      "VERIFICATION OF SUPPLY CHAIN Our procurement process includes vetting new suppliers and carrying out a risk analysis based on the nature and value of the product or service. Our vetting process since 2017 includes collecting information from the suppliers, reviewing the supplier's information and background and performing a risk -based analysis considering the supplier's location and scope of work. As part of the vetting process we use data analytics to assess modern slavery risks.\n",

    "# Observations:\n",
    "On the whole, the model does surprisingly well at detecting subsets of documents that speak about training. It shows promise in being able to detect subsets of the document that discuss training. However, the performance of the model is not currently satisfactory on its own to classify documents. Namely:\n",
    "- The model is returning a number of irrelevant spans. For example:\n",
    "    - In doc 1 there are 3 spans returned that have nothing to do with training. However, none of these are returned for more than one question.\n",
    "    - In doc 2, like in doc 1, some spans are returned that have nothing to do with training. However, one span (the last, gold span) is related to training despite only being picked up by one question. This means that we cannot exclude spans only detected by one question.\n",
    "    - In doc 3, there are some spans getting picked up by multiple questions that do not have to do with training.\n",
    "    - Many other docs also have spans picked up that are not related to training: doc 4, doc 6 (quite a few here), doc 8, doc 9\n",
    "- The model sometimes picks up a span, but not a large-enough one. For example:\n",
    "    - In doc 3, there is an entire section about training (starting with the header \"TRAINING\" which was picked up by the purple question). However, only a few subspans of this section are returned. There is lots of important and relevant text that is skipped.\n",
    "    - In doc 4, a span is picked up by the red question: \"provide training where required and\", but in order to understand the nature of this training, we need this text from earlier in the same sentence: \"we have either already taken, or intend to take the following steps:\"\n",
    "    - In doc 6, a section was flagged, but failed to flag these adjacent texts: \"A further 455 government commercial staff, public sector and third sector organisations have attended CCS and Home Office modern slavery training events to raise awareness of modern slavery in public procurement and practical steps to prevent it.\" and \"In addition to training government commercial staff, we have worked to upskill government suppliers to help them to take effective steps to prevent modern slavery in the supply chains of the goods and services they provide government\"\n",
    "    - In doc 9, this section was not flagged: \"A specific off-the-shelf training on identifying signs of human trafficking has been developed for additional targeted implementation expectations for Bechtel colleagues in groups such as Human Resources, Procurement and Ethics and Compliance who may have a greater exposure to these areas of risk in their work. This slide deck also serves as a training for voluntary use during safety awareness briefings, project kick-off briefings, orientations, team seminars and other similar circumstances.\" However, the sentence before it which also discusses training was.\n",
    "- The model is also sometimes completely failing to flag some spans that discuss training. However, this was only observed in doc 3. For example, these spans were not flagged, nor were they near any other flagged spans:\n",
    "    - \"IPS has been supporting global compliance for more than two decades, enabling improvement in labor standards and workplace conditions, supply chain security, trade compliance and brand protection in our supply chain through monitoring, remediation, capacity building and training.\"\n",
    "    - \"Some of these stakeholders help us to manage risk through programs that enhance the rule of law (through training and capacity building) and other collaborative activities.\"\n",
    "    - \"L Brands’ Supplier Code of Conduct, our Ethics Hotline, training and the compliance standards listed in this statement help to prevent the use of forced labor in our supply chain. Our Master Sourcing Agreement, IPS Compliance Guidebook, due diligence, monitoring, remediation and training ensure that our suppliers are aware of our policies and implement our standards in their processes to minimize the risk of forced labor.\"\n",
    "- The model does not do a good job of discriminating between training already in place and training in development. For example:\n",
    "    - In doc 0, the model does an ok job of detecting that training is currently in development (blue and purple questions) but not yet in place (green and aqua questions). However, the red and gold questions probably should not have flagged here.\n",
    "    - In doc 1, \"is being rolled out\" probably should not flag for the green question (\"Is training already in place?\")\n",
    "    - In doc 8, \"We are working towards incorporating specific anti-slavery and anti-human-trafficking content into our ethics training for employees and for suppliers in high risk sectors and geographies.\" probably should not flag the gold question (\"Has training been done?\")\n",
    "- Doc 5 did not display the highlights in the correct place. It has a number of flagged spans for various questions in the df that are not showing when printed. None of the other 9 documents had a problem with this.\n",
    "- The aqua question (\"What kind of training is provided?\") seems to return shorter spans that are frequently missing important context (For example, doc 9) and are usually picked up by at least one of the other quesitons. There does not appear to be any difference in the performance of the other 5 questions asked. I did not notice any questions that returned false positives less often."

    "# Recommendations / Next Steps:\n",
    "- The outputs of this model return extraneous spans and miss important spans. Since this was just a proof of concept using a relatively small pre-trained model, the next step should be to re-run the analysis using a larger, slower model.\n",
    "- Since a common problem seems to be that the spans are too short, a method could be implemented to expand all flagged spans. For example, each span could be expanded to include the sentence immediately preceding and immediately following the flagged span.\n",
    "- The question \"What kind of training is provided?\" can be dropped.\n",
    "- There are many false positive spans returned. This is not necessarily a problem if another classifier is applied on top of the returned spans. This model is still useful in shortening the documents for ease of classification later. This can be helpful for both Machine Learning classifiers and for Human classifiers (i.e. it makes the human's job a lot easier to label a document if they only have to read a subset of the whole thing).\n",
    "    - One approach could be to use this model to filter the documents, then have humans label some of the filtered documents, then train a machine learning model on the filtered documents to predict the human labels. ML models to be considered include a sequence-classification transformer, a 1-d CNN, or even something simpler like a bag-of-words classifier.\n",
    "- Since the model does not do a good job of discriminating between training already in place and training in development, this task will likely need to fall to the subsequent classifier mentioned in the previous bullet.\n",
    "- As the discrimination task related to type of training will be pushed to subsequent models, there is no need to maintain separate spans by question. These can be compressed into a 1-d tensor where the class of each token is 1 if any of the questions flag it a 1.\n",
    "- An investigation needs to be conducted into why doc 5 did not display correctly. I suspect this is likely an issue with the token_start_locations() function due to an inconsistency in converting string to token back to string."
