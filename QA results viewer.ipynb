    "This notebook is for visualizing the results of the sliding-window QA model approach on the Modern Slavery Dataset. The approach is run in the notebook 'QA-sliding window.ipynb'. The idea behind the approach is to use a pretrained QA model (one trained on SQuAD v2 such that it can return a \"no span found\" result) to ask questions of the documents in a zero-shot configuration. Since most documents in the dataset are longer than the maximum input length, a sliding window approach is used: after the entire document is tokenized, the QA model is run on successive windows, each slid by stride=128 tokens (~1/4th of the window size). All spans returned by the QA model are recorded in a new dataframe (df_with_segments.parquet). \n",
    "\n",
    "This viewer is used to display the spans found by the QA model to investigate whether the model is providing useful filtering. As such, it is important to be able to visualize not only the spans, but also the text that the model ignored. Therefore, the entire documents are printed and the spans that were found are highlighted. The model was run with 6 potentially useful questions. Here, each question is assigned a different color as shown in the legend below. Where multiple questions returned the same span, that span is printed multiple times, once in each color."

      "AO World plc (“AO”) fully supports the government’s objectives to eradicate modern slavery and human trafficking.\n",
      "About AO World plc\n",
      "We sell major and small domestic appliances and consumer electronics in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands and deliver them via our in-house logistics business and carefully selected third parties. We also provide ancillary services such as the installation of new and collection of old products and offer product protection plans and customer finance. Via our state of the art facility we are also able to carry out the recycling of waste appliances in the UK. We have a unique and vibrant culture and a team of people who genuinely care more about our business and its customers and currently employ over 2,800 people. For further details on the structure of our business and our Corporate Social Responsibility report please read our latest annual report and accounts.\n",
      "About our supply chain\n",
      "AO’s supply chain network covers the products we sell, the transportation and delivery of such products and our day-to-day operations.\n",
      "The electrical appliances we sell are generally purchased from local supplier subsidiaries in country which are part of larger global organisations. These relationships are managed by dedicated teams based in each of our territories. Supply chains are often complex in terms of structure with a significant number of layers.\n",
      "Our policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking\n",
      "Our anti-slavery policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships, helping to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our business. We expect all those in our supply chain to comply with this approach.\n",
      "Our due diligence during the reporting period\n",
      "Prior to entering into agreements with manufacturers (suppliers) we issue them with a compliance form which is designed to assess areas of potential risk within our supply chains and aims to ensure that manufacturer suppliers have their own clearly defined ethical working practices including suitable anti‐slavery and human trafficking policies and processes within their businesses and confirmation that they comply with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.\n",
      "Further steps\n",
      "Going forward we intend to continue to enhance our supplier due diligence process. We\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "recognise that due to the large number of supplier relationships throughout our business a risk based approach is appropriate in seeking to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our business or our supply chain.\n",
      "We have established a process to allow the Group to identify its higher risk relationships which enables us to tailor our supplier due diligence accordingly. We will continue to refine this process. To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business \u001b[6;30;41mwe will also aim to develop training for our staff, \u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[6;30;45mwe will also aim to develop training for our staff, \u001b[0mand encourage them to identify and report any potential concerns.\n",
      "We will assess any instances of non‐compliance on a case‐by‐case basis and tailor any remedial action appropriately.\n",
      "This statement is made in accordance with Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes AO World plc and its UK incorporated subsidiaries AO Retail Limited, Expert Logistics Limited and AO Deutschland Limited’s anti‐slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2018. It sets out the steps taken, and those which AO intends to take in the future to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business.\n",
      "The statement has been approved by the AO World plc Board of Directors who will review and update it on an annual basis.\n",

      "OUR BUSINESS Zalando is a leading European online fashion platform for women, men and children serving 15 European markets. Our operating activities include development, sourcing, marketing and retail. Via our online store we sell apparel, shoes and accessories from different international brands as well as private label products. The latter are managed, sourced and sold by Zalando SE’s wholly-owned subsidiary, zLabels GmbH. zLabels goods are produced in 27 countries across the world. In 2016, we sourced our products from 278 suppliers with 464 factories. We do not own any of the production facilities. In order to sell products, Zalando has built a complex online platform, providing partners with services including IT intelligence or fulfilment. All transportation services from the countries of production to the customer as well as the return process are provided by business partners.\n",
      "Zalando’s supply chain\n",
      "The core of Zalando’s operations is conducted in Germany with a centralized team located at our headquarters in Berlin. We also have Technology Hubs in Dortmund, Hamburg, Dublin and Helsinki. Our products are globally sourced and then dispatched from our own fulfillment centers including four in Germany and an international one in Northern Italy. Two new Zalando fulfillment centers are expected to open in 2017, one in France and one in Poland. Our German fulfillment centers are operated by Zalando, whilst international ones are operated by third-party logistics service providers. Customer service is provided by Zalando teams and external service providers. Managing a global supply chain poses many challenges, especially regarding human rights, labor conditions, and the environment. We are constantly evaluating the impact of our business at each stage in the value chain in order to find the right solution for different challenges. We approach the supply chain management for third-party brands and our private labels differently. For our private labels, our level of inﬂuence is evidently higher so we engage directly with our suppliers in the sourcing countries and will share our approach in more detail in this document. When it comes to our third-party brands and other service providers, we also recognize the responsibility we share to improve the conditions in the value chain. We define minimum standards for all our partners on topics such as human rights and labor practices in our Code of Conduct for Business Partners.\n",
      "page 1 / 3 MODERN SLAVERY ACT STATEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "OUR POLICIES Human trafficking and forced labor is a violation of human rights. Zalando does not tolerate modern slavery in its operations nor in its supply chain.\n",
      "Our commitment to avoid human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain is underpinned in our Code of Conduct for Business Partners. The Code was established in 2013 and is overseen by Zalando’s Management Board. It applies to various business partners group-wide, including but not limited to vendors, suppliers, agents, trading companies and service providers. The Code was revised in 2016 and is publicly available on our website.\n",
      "The Code of Conduct expressly prohibits the use of forced, bonded, indentured and prison labor, as well as the slavery or trafficking of persons in any form. Supply chain job seekers shall not be compelled to work through force, deception, intimidation, or coercion. All work shall be voluntary, and workers shall be free to terminate their employment upon reasonable notice without penalty. Additionally, holding, confiscating or destroying original worker identification documents, passports, travel papers or other personal documents is prohibited.\n",
      "Ensuring good working conditions in our fulfillment centers is a priority for Zalando. Since 2012 we have processes in place to closely monitor the social standards at both our own and partner fulfillment centers. The implementation and maintenance of the social standards are reviewed on a regular basis both internally and externally by the independent testing and certification company, DEKRA. DEKRA checks take place on an unannounced basis approximately twice a year. These checks cover, among other topics, that no forced labour is taking place and that working hours do not exceed the legal regulations.\n",
      "At zLabels GmbH we have a robust Ethical Trading program in place. As part of our onboarding process, all new suppliers and factories must sign up to the Zalando Code of Conduct for Business Partners. In addition, all factories must provide a recent audit done by an accredited, external third-party. Based on the findings of the audit, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is developed and we ask our suppliers and their factories to demonstrate improvement in all identified areas. No orders can be placed without setting up a factory on our system and this is only done if it meets all our ethical requirements as laid down in our Code of Conduct.\n",
      "For a new factory setup, if critical findings are observed, we do not begin the relationship without evidence that the existing findings have been remediated. If a critical non-compliance (NC) is found at an existing factory, we require evidence of improvement to continue our business relationship. We work with nominated third-party consultants who provide external support on resolving NCs at our suppliers’ factories. In addition to our third party audit program, the zLabels Ethical Trade team also visits approximately 10% of all strategic factories annually to ensure our Code of Conduct is being followed.\n",
      "We have an ethical database that connects various parts of our business to factory ethical information. On the database, suppliers can manage their factories, audits and CAPs. This system was put in place to increase transparency of our process with suppliers and also within other parts of the zLabels business. This new system allows us to easily track each factory’s progress and provides reminders to suppliers and their factories on uploading evidence and CAP closures.\n",
      "We carry out business partner due diligence for all partners of an entity of the Zalando group which are associated with a potential higher risk according to our Group Policy “Compliance Checks on Business Partners”.\n",

      "\f",
      "RISK MANAGEMENT All areas of our business, including logistics, HR, technology, operations and procurement, have been risk-mapped. Zalando has a group-wide centralized Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) function, which comprises the Risk Management and the Compliance Management. It closely collaborates with the Internal Audit team, the Legal teams (Commercial Law and Corporate Legal) and the Corporate Responsibility team. All aforementioned teams are headed by the General Counsel. The Governance, Risk & Compliance function carries out regular risk workshops with key stakeholders in the Zalando group and Internal Audit carries out regular audits on processes in different functions. The GRC function and the Ethical Trade function are also subject to internal audits. Furthermore, the Supplier Management function was audited in 2015, and the agreed follow-up measures were reviewed by the Internal Audit function in 2016. zLabels GmbH has a dedicated Ethical Trade team to oversee risks and countermeasures regarding the supply chain for our own private labels. The team has completed a mapping exercise of zLabels’ apparel and footwear supply chain and identified high risk geographical areas. We have developed a new categorization of our high risk countries and identified programs or additional requirements for all new factories in these countries.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "As a company that carries out a portion of its business in the United Kingdom, Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated and its subsidiaries (“JLL”) approves and issues this Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement under Section 54(1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA). JLL carries on business in the UK through its UK based affiliates, including Jones Lang LaSalle Limited and LaSalle Investment Management, but our responsibilities and commitment to uphold the principles of the Modern Slavery Act extends across all of our operations.\n",
      "As one of the world’s leading professional services firms, JLL is committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards and to engaging in practices that enhance the welfare, safety, and well-being of our employees and wider communities. JLL respects and supports human rights principles as defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2009. JLL works to ensure that we do not violate these human rights principles through our business operations and activities.\n",
      "Our commitment to human rights extends to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to preventing modern slavery from occurring anywhere in our supply chain. We therefore expect all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners to embrace JLL’s Core Values of Teamwork, Ethics and Excellence. Our contracting processes highlight and reinforce JLL’s strong commitment to ethical behavior by including specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labor, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children. Further, we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.\n",
      "As a global company, we recognize the many challenges in managing and monitoring a complex supply chain. We continue to review our approach to human rights and modern slavery issues within our business and our supply chains and believe that we have identified some important focus areas and initiatives to build on in the future.\n",

      "About JLL\n",
      "JLL is a Fortune 500 professional services and investment management firm specializing in real estate. We offer integrated services worldwide to clients seeking increased value by owning, occupying, developing, or investing in real estate. Globally, JLL’s 77,000 employees serve clients in more than 80 countries, and we are an industry leader in property and corporate facility management services. In FY 2016, JLL’s consolidated revenue exceeded $6.8 billion.\n",
      "JLL’s human rights and anti-slavery program forms part of Building a Better Tomorrow, our sustainability leadership agenda. Building a Better Tomorrow is about creating spaces, buildings and cities where everyone can thrive. By thinking and acting sustainably we strive to do just that for our employees, clients, shareholders and communities.\n",
      "JLL has been recognized by Ethisphere for ten consecutive years as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies. The company has achieved a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, and has been named to CR Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens.\n",
      "A list of JLL’s offices appears on pages 14 and 15 in our Annual Report. Our services and operations span three geographic business segments: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. Within this vast global network, JLL’s activities range from those having relatively low risk with regard to modern slavery, such as within LaSalle Investment Management, and activities that present more risk. For example, JLL procures a significant amount of goods and services on behalf of our clients, whose properties we manage. Among these business partners are suppliers in sectors identified as higher risk for modern slavery practices: construction, janitorial, landscaping and ground maintenance, food and drink, and security services. In general, JLL’s policies and procedures are designed to identify unethical business partners before we engage them and to monitor our suppliers to make sure they maintain ethical standards that match JLL’s.\n",

      "Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking\n",
      "\n",
      "JLL has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we are committed to strengthening and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in our supply chain. We also are committed to ensuring compliance with any applicable modern slavery laws, including the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015.\n",
      "Our policy on slavery and human trafficking is part of our corporate Code of Business Ethics as well as our Vendor Code of Conduct, both of which have been published in multiple languages on our public website. These documents set forth our zerotolerance policy, and explicitly forbid child labor, human trafficking, debt bondage, forced or slave labor of any kind, inhumane conditions, substandard wages, and physical abuse or discipline. In addition, the Codes provide options for reporting violations or potential violations which are available to\n",
      "\n",
      "employees and to our suppliers, such as calling JLL’s Global Ethics Helpline or using JLL’s ethics reports website, contacting one of JLL’s Ethics Officers, or sending a letter to JLL’s Global General Counsel and Chief Ethics Officer.\n",
      "JLL also has a Corporate Governance Policy devoted to Vendor Due Diligence Guidelines that prohibits doing business with suppliers engaging in illegal practices or any questionable practices that may result in credit, reputation, or litigation issues for JLL.\n",
      "We are in the process of implementing a separate corporate governance policy addressing Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking. This policy will apply to all JLL employees and to suppliers and other third-party business associates worldwide. It identifies specific prohibited activities, and includes mechanisms for employees to report violations or potential violations of the policy.\n",

      "Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, JLL is doing the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "■ Building a global procurement policy and risk management framework to incorporate Modern Slavery Act (MSA) compliance as we prequalify and monitor our suppliers over time. Currently, JLL performs due diligence for modern slavery using a risk-based approach, typically for suppliers servicing the Corporate Solutions business, which is the business most likely to engage third parties in high-risk sectors. Increasingly throughout our global operations, these suppliers must attest in a pre-engagement questionnaire and in their contract with JLL that they do not engage in any of the activities comprising modern slavery, and must renew that attestation annually. It is expected that the policy and risk management framework in due course will help us to expand our Vendor Due Diligence and Compliance Program globally through a technology platform that allows realtime communication and information sharing between suppliers, JLL’s third-party independent compliance administrator, JLL’s internal sourcing experts, and our individual client account teams.\n",
      "■ Requiring our suppliers to comply with all applicable modern slavery and labour laws and to comply with our own Vendor Code of Conduct, which sets forth explicitly JLL’s expectation that suppliers will act in accordance with human rights principles in employment and provides mechanisms for suppliers to report suspicions or incidents of breach, including through our Ethics Helpline which is available on a 24 hour basis in all major languages.\n",
      "■ Strengthening the ethics clause of our EMEA vendor contract templates by including a warranty specifically referring to the principles of the MSA.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ Enhancing our Global Vendor Onboarding Initiative by building additional due diligence steps into JLL’s procurement process, including, for example, subscribing to EcoVadis’s Corporate Social Responsibility database.\n",
      "■ Incorporating into our due diligence technology platform data from Walk Free Foundation’s Global Slavery Index to help us identify high-risk geographies and sectors within our supply chain. We are working in collaboration with the Walk Free Foundation to identify ways to raise awareness of modern slavery and best practices in our procurement and audit functions and at all levels of our supply chains, particularly in service lines and countries that present a greater risk of modern slavery.\n",
      "■ Incorporating MSA questions into JLL’s Global Internal Audit Vendor Questionnaire, and working with our Internal Audit Group to develop audit procedures designed to identify potential non-compliance by suppliers.\n",
      "■ Adopting the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition’s Code, which incorporates labor standards prohibiting modern slavery and human trafficking, enterprise wide.\n",
      "■ Developing an MSA Risk Assessment to examine all business lines for risk of modern slavery.\n",
      "■ Strengthening our Global Human Resources policies to ensure we have adequate internal procedures to uphold fair labor practices.\n",
      "■ Encouraging our businesses, through our Vendor Due Diligence Policy, to work with enterprises that share JLL’s values, and to develop and maintain supplier relationships that are consistent with protecting JLL’s overall interests.\n",

      "We operate in over 80 countries around the world, including countries identified in the Global Slavery Index 2016 as having the highest proportion of their populations in modern slavery: India, Bangladesh, Russia, Colombia, Egypt, Turkey, and Thailand. In providing real estate services, JLL may engage suppliers in some sectors in which modern slavery is prevalent, including construction, janitorial, landscaping and ground maintenance, hospitality, and security services. JLL assesses and manages these risks through its zero-tolerance policy and the due-diligence processes identified above.\n",
      "Our Effectiveness in Combatting Slavery and Human Trafficking\n",
      "JLL’s processes for engaging suppliers, as outlined above, are aimed at identifying and avoiding business associations with suppliers that engage in slavery and human trafficking practices, and our\n",
      "\n",
      "suppliers have ongoing compliance and reporting duties during the entire course of their business relationship with JLL. Through our ability to audit suppliers for contractual and legal compliance, we can investigate changed circumstances or suspected noncompliance. Although we are not aware of noncompliance situations in the past or in our current supply chain, we recognize that our current approach may not be effective in all cases. Accordingly, we are committed to a journey of continued improvement.\n",
      "Internally, JLL focuses on its extensive global “Ethics Everywhere” program to foster a culture of ethical behavior that encompasses awareness of and adherence to basic human rights principles. \u001b[6;30;43mWe are working towards incorporating specific anti-slavery and anti-human-trafficking content into our ethics training for employees and for suppliers in high risk sectors and geographies.\n",

The toolkit has been developed in multiple languages. It functions as guidance to combat modern slavery and provides details on how to engage with employees, how to approach a recruitment agent and what due diligence info to collect. The launch of the toolkit is done in 3 of the 7 geographical areas in Europe, Middle East & Africa. Remaining areas will follow in Q1 2017.\n",

      "Additional to the Supplier Code of Conduct, the nominated suppliers to Rezidor are expected to complete the responsible business supplier questionnaire. Results of the questionnaire are used for supplier assessment, evaluation and will be a discussion point for yearly meetings. We are at the beginning of rolling out of the responsible business supplier questionnaire in the new procurement system.\n",
      "Risk Mapping in procurement system Risk mapping has been completed to facilitate analysis of supplier performance. The mapping is performed weighting various criteria of spend, risk, impact, likelihood of success. The Rezidor Hotel Group was part of the ITP supply chain working group to develop this rating tool. The next phase of supplier due diligence is to perform a risk mapping analysis of the supply chain. First results of the implementation of the risk mapping tool into the corporate procurement system, and analysis of the responsible business supplier questionnaire, are expected in 2017.\n",

The Group is a member of the International Tourism Partnership (ITP), which provides a voice for environmental and social responsibility in the industry. In June 2015, Wolfgang M.

Employees can use this site to find information on our Code of Business Ethics and report concerns anonymously. Any employee with concerns or questions about the Code is encouraged to raise these directly with their supervisor or person of trust in the hotel or regional organization. If this is not possible, the employee can report the issue online. The site and hotline are available in eleven languages for all employees, outsourced employees and agency workers.

      "Rezidor encourages any stakeholder with concerns about the Supplier Code of Conduct and its implementation to discuss this directly with the Supplier.\n",
      "If the Supplier does not act or respond to the report or concern and is not willing to work on correcting the issue, the Supplier can be subjected to disciplinary actions, including termination as a Rezidor Supplier and/ or review by local authorities. However, best practice suggests trying to work with the agency to improve their practice rather than dropping them out of hand. Suppliers are requested to notify their employees, and any subcontractors related to work for Rezidor, that they may report serious or sensitive concerns or a possible breach of the Supplier Code of Conduct. If Rezidor receives such a report, we will ask the Supplier to comment and, if necessary, we may request an improvement plan to correct the issue.\n",

      "Modern slavery is a human rights issue that does not occur in a vacuum. We explore its links to other risks like corruption to ensure an integrated approach. Our control framework includes various policies and standards, some directly referencing modern slavery, others with more general human rights requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our global code of business conduct, The way we work, our Human rights policy and Employment policy state that we reject any form of slavery and prohibit the use of forced, bonded or child labour. The way we work expressly applies to Rio Tinto’s consultants, agents, contractors and suppliers and we strive to ensure compliance by our non-managed JVs and companies. Our Human rights policy confirms our approach is consistent with global principles in the area.\n",
      "In 2016, we replaced our Procurement principles with our Supplier code of conduct which is part of our contractual arrangements with existing and new suppliers. It sets out our expectations of suppliers, their subsidiaries and subcontractors with respect to key issues including human rights. This includes ensuring all work is freely chosen and without the use of forced or compulsory labour. The Supplier code of conduct confirms we may choose not to work with suppliers who do not meet our expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complementing the Supplier code of conduct, our Procurement standard provides that based on a threshold determination (nature of goods or services, vendor, country of origin) commercial commitments must not be made without a supplier risk assessment and due diligence. The Know your supplier procedure detailed below explains how to implement this in practice. Our Business integrity standard also contains requirements around third-party risk assessment and due diligence.\n",
      "Our board Sustainability Committee monitors compliance with our human rights-related policies and standards and a cross-functional human rights working group helps implement a coordinated human rights approach at the operational level.\n",

      "\n",
      "We may conduct standalone human rights studies at high-risk sites. All sites are required to investigate and resolve all actual, suspected and alleged human rights breaches that involve community members in line with Rio Tinto’s Human rights policy. Meaningful stakeholder consultation, including with affected rights-holders as appropriate, plays a central role in these processes.\n",
      "Due diligence regarding suppliers includes a range of steps applied as appropriate, such as pre-qualification checks, contractual arrangements and ongoing monitoring.\n",
      "In 2016 we launched the Know your supplier procedure, a standardised integrity due diligence process to identify the potential legal, ethical or reputational risks of engaging or renewing a supplier including around human rights. This procedure replaced previous business level integrity due diligence processes and is undergoing a staged roll out for new and existing suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a risk-based approach, the decision to conduct detailed due diligence is based on the goods or services, country of origin and vendor including spend level. Due diligence reports cover identified human rights risks, including modern slavery.\n",
      "Grievance mechanisms can strengthen human rights due diligence by highlighting systemic issues. Under our Communities and Social Performance (CSP) standard, all sites are required to have a complaints, disputes and grievance procedure in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights’ (UNGPs) criteria of effectiveness for non-judicial grievance mechanisms. Speak-OUT, the Group’s confidential and independently operated whistle blowing service is available to all employees, suppliers and contractors to report concerns.

      "We consider human rights risks in our operations using integrated Group-wide processes and standalone studies. Internal guidance states that both approaches should explore all relevant human rights risks, with specific reference to modern slavery in some instances. For example, our Social risk analysis guidance recommends sites consider risks relating to their impacts on forced labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our businesses have different modern slavery risks depending on various factors, including the level of human rights protection and enforcement where they are operating. We use tools to better understand local human rights contexts as well as exposure to related issues such as corruption including the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index and Verisk Maplecroft Human Rights Atlas. While high-risk jurisdictions mainly correlate to our operations in, or suppliers from, emerging markets, we know human rights issues can happen anywhere.\n",
      "Cross-functional teams have discussed what types of goods and services we procure may be higher risk for human rights including modern slavery. Construction, shipping, cleaning and catering and travel services were amongst the higher-risk activities identified depending on the local context. We have highlighted that increased due diligence around human rights including modern slavery may be needed when suppliers bring larger numbers of employees or contractors, especially those who are lower skilled and providing physical labour, onto Rio Tinto locations.\n",
      "When a human rights incident occurs, we seek to mitigate the situation as appropriate based on our policies and standards. In line with the UNGPs this may include remediation based on our involvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some operations have initiated their own risk assessment and mitigation processes regarding suppliers alongside Group procedures. Responding to identified risks around payment of wages and working conditions on chartered ships, in 2016 Rio Tinto Marine (RTM) implemented initiatives to help ensure all vessels arriving at Rio Tinto ports provided a Maritime Labour Certificate and/or associated declaration of maritime labour compliance. We are aware of one incident in 2016 of failure to pay wages on a ship chartered by a subsidiary. When concerns were raised RTM immediately asked the ship owner and manager to resolve any wages and working conditions matters. RTM will continue to review its chartering and due diligence processes to further respond to third-party risks, including non-payment of wages.\n",
      "Rio Tinto Procurement Emerging Markets, largely focused on suppliers from India, China and South East Asia, has instituted self-assessment on a range of issues including forced labour. This helps to better understand suppliers and introduce mitigation measures where needed.\n",
      "Following a human rights risk analysis which identified labour rights amongst other risks, a project in Africa incorporated a standalone human rights annex into a major construction tender, including requirements around forced labour. This helped map the expertise required for a contractor to be selected in a high-risk jurisdiction.\n",

      "Ares recognizes the importance of ensuring that its business is conducted responsibly. Over 20 years, Ares has built a strong track record of disciplined investment practices and demonstrated a commitment to adhering to legal and regulatory mandates as well as establishing voluntary, responsible policies, procedures and practices for its investors and for the companies and communities in which it invests. Ares' Code of Business Conduct and Ethics promotes, among other things, a best practices approach to the conduct of Ares' business activities.\n",

      "Policies and Procedures\n",
      "During 2017, we initiated procedures to incorporate standard MSA provisions into applicable contracts, addressing the requirements of MSA at the point of engagement. In addition, Ares performs an annual supply chain survey of critical vendors.

      "Introduction\n",
      "This policy statement, is published pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) and constitutes Findlay Park Partners LLP (the “Firm’s”) slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2019.\n",
      "As a business, we are not involved in the supply or manufacturing of goods so our risk of exposure to human trafficking and slavery is limited. However, we are committed to ensuring that we prevent, to the extent possible, any illegal activity from taking place within the Firm’s supply chain.\n",
      "Organisational structure\n",
      "We are a UK regulated Investment Management firm which has been appointed as the Investment Manager for Findlay Park Funds PLC (the “Fund”), an Irish domiciled Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities scheme with one sub-fund, the Findlay Park American Fund.\n",
      "The Firm is a limited liability partnership owned by its members and does not belong to a group or have a place of business in any other country outside the UK.\n",
      "Our business and employees\n",
      "On 31st March 2019 we employed 42 people, all of whom operated out of the Firm’s office in London. We are committed to ensuring that anyone who works for the Firm benefits from a working environment in which their fundamental human rights are respected and that anyone we do business with shares these principles.\n",
      "We provide fair working conditions for all our employees, including written terms and conditions governing their employment, remuneration, working hours, health and safety, resting time, holiday entitlements and benefits. Background checks are carried out on all new employees in order to ensure that they have the right to work in the U.K.\n",
      "Our supply chains\n",
      "Our supply chains consist of various direct suppliers who typically provide services to the financial services industry in the U.K or U.S. These third parties are generally software and IT infrastructure providers, professional advisors, office support services providers or regulated research providers. The relationship with suppliers is usually governed by a written contract.\n",
      "On-going risk assessment and due diligence process\n",
      "When on-boarding new service providers the Firm has a process in place which assesses the risk of exposure to modern slavery and human trafficking. This involves reviewing the risks associated with the service provider’s country, sector and industry, and the nature of the specific transaction. The purpose of this risk assessment is to identify any high-risk service providers which require enhanced due diligence to ensure that they meet the requirements of the Act and have their own Modern Slavery Statement and procedures in place to mitigate risk.\n",
      "The Firm as a rule does not source or undertake services in high-risk countries where forms of slavery are prevalent.\n",
      "Being a financial institution, the Firm may potentially be at risk of facilitating the investment of financial proceeds which originate from modern slavery and bonded labour in operations or supply chains or through money laundering. The Firm has implemented policies and procedures for the mitigation of such risk including Anti-Money Laundering systems and controls.\n",

      "Our policies on modern slavery and human trafficking\n",
      "We are committed to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking involved in our supply chains or in any part of our business.\n",

      "DS Smith Plc (“DS Smith”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are committed to the highest ethical standards in the way in which we engage with each other and our customers, staff, shareholders, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our reputation as a Group is founded on our achievement of these high standards.\n",
      "DS Smith builds relationships based upon our core values – to be caring, challenging, trusted, responsive and tenacious – and will do so in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. As a Group, we maintain relationships with many different organisations in our supply chain, as well as directly employing large numbers of people. DS Smith has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery both within the Group and within its supply chain.\n",
      "This is the first of the statements that the Group is required to produce under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and DS Smith will report annually on a number of matters such as policy, training, due diligence processes and the effectiveness of measures taken to combat slavery and trafficking, to drive transparency and promote ethical principles and practices related to the prevention of the exploitation and abuse associated with modern slavery and human trafficking. This encompasses a statement of the steps we have taken, including those taken during the financial year, to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in any part of our supply chain or any aspect of our business.\n",
      "Our Business\n",
      "DS Smith is a leading provider of corrugated packaging in Europe and of specialist plastic packaging worldwide, supported by paper and recycling operations. Present in 36 countries, employing around 26,000 people, we are dedicated to creating sustainable value for our stakeholders and ensuring DS Smith is an engaging employer in which our people can thrive and fulfil their potential.\n",
      "Our core business is the design and manufacture of multi-way and recycled packaging for consumer goods. We recognise that our operations have both direct and indirect impacts. Those are upstream through our sourcing activities and downstream through the ways our customers use and dispose of our products.\n",
      "Our Policies\n",
      "Our Group-wide Code of Conduct states that DS Smith respects fundamental human rights and is committed to the principles set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We support and respect the protection of human rights within our sphere of influence; in particular the effective elimination of compulsory labour and child labour. The Code of Conduct governs all our business dealings and the conduct of all persons or organisations with whom we contract directly or who we appoint to act on our behalf.\n",
      "Our Global Supplier Standard is being updated and is currently being rolled out within each division. This standard contains the requirements for quality and sustainable development imposed by DS Smith on its suppliers. It refers to international standards and defines specific DS Smith requirements. We have generally been asking raw material suppliers to confirm adherence to our Global Supplier Standards now for a number of years. These standards include sections on “code of conduct” and ethical behaviour. We are now extending this beyond the raw material suppliers and have specifically referenced the Modern Slavery Act within the document. We expect commitment to these principles from all organisations with which we do business and will not support or do\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "business with any individual or organisation that is knowingly involved in slavery or human trafficking.\n",
      "The Anti-slavery and human trafficking policy (“the Policy”) has been approved by the DS Smith Board and has been circulated to the DS Smith community. It is also available for employees to access on our intranet portal. It covers a variety of matters including the steps that should be taken to assist staff in the prevention of modern slavery with our suppliers by conducting risk assessments and supplier pre-screening. The Policy also requires that \u001b[6;30;41mmanagers at all levels are responsible for providing adequate training on the issue of modern slavery to those reporting to them so that they understand and comply with the Group policy. \u001b[0mActions to report modern slavery or human trafficking are listed, including the use of our employee hotline. We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy. The Policy will also be communicated to any newly acquired businesses as part of the integration process and will be reviewed at least annually by the Board.\n",
      "Due Diligence\n",
      "We expect our suppliers to respect human rights, including maintaining policies and procedures to prevent the use of child or forced labour. For two years now we have conducted self-assessment audits on our own sites, which includes questions about human rights impacts including forced labour and also about the number of local supplier assessments performed by the site which cover human rights and modern slavery issues. We have conducted a number of high-level risk assessments to determine which parts of our business and which of our suppliers are most at risk of modern slavery so that efforts can be focused on those areas, these will continue throughout the year and our findings so far can be found below.\n",
      "There are clear standards of ethics and behaviour as defined in our operating framework, including extensive management arrangements governing health, safety and product integrity and safety for all Group operations.\n",
      "Accountability and Results\n",
      "We all have a responsibly to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. Employees are expected to report concerns and management are expected to act upon them. If an issue is identified with a supplier we will work with them to prepare a corrective action plan and resolve all violations within an agreed upon time period. In our revised Global Supplier Standard we reserve the right to terminate our relationship with individuals and organisations in our supply chain if found to be in breach of our anti-slavery and human trafficking policy.\n",
      "Our procedures are designed to:\n",
      " Establish and assess areas of potential risk in our business and supply chains;  Monitor potential risk areas in our business and supply chains;  Reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and supply chains;  Provide adequate protection for whistle blowers.\n",
      "The Group operations will regularly assess its exposure to modern slavery as evidenced through the activities of human trafficking, child and forced labour in our supplier base and their supply chains. Our preliminary assessment is focussed on our first tier suppliers. It is based upon geography, product and/or raw material category, the nature of the business transaction (by expenditure) and supplier quality performance. DS Smith performs its modern slavery risk assessment using input from external sources as well as its own investigations. We have started by\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "undertaking a risk assessment for all our Tier 1 suppliers in all territories, which we expect to complete by the end of the calendar year.\n",
      "As a result of these assessments, we added a number of countries to our list of high-priority supplier areas. This high-priority country list, combined with our procurement selection procedures and contracting standards has been adapted to ensure we have sufficient assurance to verify that our suppliers conform to the requirements as set out in the Modern Slavery Act, 2015. This is supported through a selection process for supplier audits to verify that compliance is maintained and any learnings adapted to prioritize our procurement training and overall supplier assessment efforts.\n",
      "In 2015 we selected audits at a number of our direct supplier factories in our high risk supplier areas to monitor compliance with Group expectations and legal requirements. These audits are based on the due diligence undertaken during our selection process and are considered reasonable and proportionate, reflecting the overall size of risk the Group is exposed to. Our audits are independent and we select facilities to audit based upon the risk assessment as described above. If any issues are identified during an audit, the supplier is required to prepare a corrective action plan and resolve all violations within an agreed upon time period.\n",
      "Education and Training To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, \u001b[6;30;41mwe will provide training to relevant members of staff. \u001b[0m\n",

All Directors have been briefed on the subject. \u001b[0mManagers at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with the relevant policies in place and are given proper training on those policies and the issue of modern slavery where it may be relevant to their roles.\n",
      "The Group’s “Speak Up!” whistleblowing policy provides guidance on how concerns can be communicated to the Group on a confidential basis. Concerns about suspected modern slavery associated with the Group or our suppliers may be reported by employees in this manner.\n",

      "OUR BUSINESS\n",
      "CHANEL was established in Paris 1909 by Mademoiselle Chanel as a luxury brand selling luxury fashion. CHANEL is an independent company that creates, markets, distributes and sells luxury Fragrances & Beauty, Fashion (including Haute Couture, Accessories and Eyewear) and Watches & Fine Jewellery products. Today, the house of CHANEL operates across 70 countries worldwide.\n",
      "CHANEL is dedicated to creating innovative and desirable products of the highest quality and finest craftsmanship. We invest in the excellence of our products and favour a long-term vision to ensure the longevity of the brand. A large proportion of our products are manufactured at in-house facilities in France as well as with select third party partners. Our supply base consists of more than 3000 suppliers around the world, split between what we term \"direct procurement\" (e.g. finished goods, componentry and raw materials) and \"indirect procurement\" (e.g. sales, promotional and marketing materials such as shopping bags and displays etc). Of these suppliers, over 1400 supply chain partners are for our Fashion activity, 69% of which supply finished goods. The majority is based in Europe (France and Italy). Our Fragrances & Beauty activity has over 900 suppliers, 69% of which provide raw materials. 27% of these partners supply natural raw materials of strategic importance for the brand, giving us direct access to the source of origin. Our Watches & Fine Jewellery activity has 34 suppliers, supplying gold, diamonds, and other precious stones. For indirect procurement of non-product items related to the customer experience, we have over 670 suppliers.\n",
      "OUR POLICIES ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n",
      "CHANEL is strongly committed to conducting its business in compliance with all applicable labour and employment-related laws, rules and regulations of every location in which we do business and across our supply chain, including, but not limited to, laws, rules and regulations relating to wages and hours worked, equal employment opportunity, discrimination, immigration and work authorisation, privacy, collective bargaining, and child, prison and forced labour. Our internal code of conduct Ethics@Chanel, provides the global ethical principles for all CHANEL employees which reflect our core values and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "Our approach to partnering with suppliers is governed by our Responsible Sourcing Policy. Reflecting our internal code of conduct, this policy sets out our expectations and requirements regarding issues such as forced and slave labour, human rights, the environment, and anti-corruption. We carefully select our suppliers and business partners and maintain business relationships with those that share our commitment to high ethical standards. CHANEL expects its suppliers and business partners to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations as well as our Responsible Sourcing Policy.\n",
      "CHANEL’s Responsible Sourcing Policy has been updated in 2018 to reflect regulatory changes as well as evolving practices. In addition to focusing on continuous improvement of our suppliers’ processes in connection with the audits that are performed, the policy specifically requires our partners to comply with all internal obligations and principles relating to Human Rights, whilst also referencing International Labour Organization core conventions governing forced and slave labour. \u001b[6;30;41mGuidance on applying the policy is provided through annual supplier fora and ongoing support to suppliers from trained professionals in our procurement teams. \u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;43mGuidance on applying the policy is provided through annual supplier fora and ongoing support to suppliers from trained professionals in our procurement teams. \u001b[0mCHANEL’s Responsible Sourcing Policy’s principles have been rolled out across all activities and regions in 2018 including Fragrances & Beauty, Watches & Fine Jewellery and Fashion.\n",
      "RISK ASSESSMENTS\n",
      "Our approach to risk assessment is underpinned by a three-step process:\n",
      "• First, all suppliers are assessed according to criteria relating to the state of the business relationship (purchasing volumes, dependency), social and environmental issues associated with the value-adding activity undertaken by the supplier, and potential reputational risks for the brand, in particular with regard to their dependencies on the brand as a major buyer. This exercise is conducted on an ongoing basis with the procurement teams and requires, at a minimum, tracing the value-adding activity back to the last transformation stage. Based on our risk assessment approach we have identified where there are areas of actual and potential risk with a small number of our suppliers from a business dependency, CSR and/or reputational perspective. As outlined below we work to mitigate and manage risk wherever it occurs.\n",
      "• Second, to better understand supplier management of social and environmental risks at a more granular level, suppliers are requested to selfassess against CHANEL’s in-house standards using an online tool called the SEP (Sustainability Excellence Program). \u001b[6;30;45mThe SEP was first developed in 2011 in \u001b[0mline with international norms, guidelines and principles, including the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains, and is submitted to\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "external experts for critical review on an ongoing basis, to ensure it covers all relevant issues, and continues to set a high level of what CHANEL expects from its suppliers. This CHANEL meta-tool has been designed to be both holistic (covering social, environmental, governance and ethics topics) and exemplary – establishing a high bar for the rest of the industry in relation to supplier performance on these issues.\n",
      "• Finally, based on the results from the first two steps, CHANEL's internal auditors plan and implement in-person audits on an annual basis. During 2017, we conducted over 200 such audits. Over the next two years, we plan to conduct over 500 audits of this nature across our diverse supply base.\n",
      "In addition to our risk analysis at the corporate level, CHANEL has commissioned independent third parties to conduct in-depth human rights impact assessments at the source of our raw material supply chains, when actual and potential risks have been identified.\n",
      "For example, in India and Madagascar, impact assessments consisted of on-site visits and qualitative interviews with farmers, suppliers, local stakeholders and other rights holders, to better understand the scale of the risk, its potential severity, remediability, and the leverage for CHANEL to influence it. Human rights impacts are also systematically assessed on site by our responsible sourcing teams before and during the implementation of supply chain reinforcement projects, at the source of our key raw materials supply chains located around the world.\n",
      "We seek ongoing dialogue with stakeholders and experts to help guide us and support us in our human rights approach. Earlier this year, with the help of the leading centre of expertise on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Shift, we convened functional leads from across the business to discuss and prioritise our salient human rights issues, along with an action plan to address them. Certain raw material supply chains, including mica, gold, and precious stones, were considered as being of a potential risk from a human rights perspective. They will continue to be a focus for our supply chain responsibility efforts going forward through direct interventions and through our ongoing participation in multi-industry collaborative initiatives, including the Responsible Mica Initiative and the Responsible Jewellery Council (“RJC”) (CHANEL is certified by the RJC and complies with the ethical principles of the RJC, including the Kimberley process for diamonds).\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n",
      "In addition to our approach to risk assessment outlined above, our due diligence process consists of the following steps to mitigate and manage any risk that our supply chain may use forced labour, slavery and human trafficking:\n",
      "• Continuing to roll out of the Responsible Sourcing Policy across all activities and regions with \u001b[6;30;41meducation and training of the procurement teams on an ongoing basis\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[6;30;44mon an ongoing basis\u001b[0m.\n",
      "• The creation of a dedicated Responsible Sourcing Expert Team at corporate level in January 2018, the mission of which is to define and update the responsible sourcing guidelines for the company and to ensure coherence in the implementation of our responsible sourcing strategy. Globally we have 5 internal and 10 external, fully dedicated, trained and certified auditors for the implementation of our Responsible Sourcing Policy.\n",
      "• Sharing knowledge and best practice across the three business activities and regions through our Responsible Sourcing Standards Committee to ensure consistency and coherence in our approach to supplier due diligence, risk assessment, monitoring and remediation.\n",
      "• Sharing ongoing audit plans and results through the SEP Committees at individual activity levels in order to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and our own internal policies relating to the prevention of human rights violations. The SEP audit results are then integrated in follow up actions and endorsed by senior management. Such results are monitored on an ongoing basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "SUMMARY\n",
      "CHANEL’s commitment to compliance with applicable laws and in particular labour laws and the prohibition of the use of forced labour is an ongoing process. The steps described above form part of a long-term programme to tackle all of the risks encountered in our supply chain, including the issue of forced labour. We recognise that the complexity of our global supply chain will require our ongoing commitment to continually monitor and find ways to improve our responsible sourcing practices in order to achieve this long-term goal.\n",
      "In addition, as part of our responsible and sustainable sourcing approach we are and will be working on:\n",
      "- Improved traceability for all of our strategic raw materials\n",
      "- greater collaboration with all of our suppliers and other stakeholders to address issues along the supply chain\n",
      "- ongoing roll out of global risk assessments for all purchasing categories\n",

      "GOODWOOD MODERN SLAVERY ACT STATEMENT Goodwood welcomes the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the duty it places on businesses to disclose publicly the steps they are taking to tackle forced labour and human trafficking, and we are committed to improving our practices to combat these. As part of this commitment we acknowledge our responsibility to ensure transparency within the Group and with our suppliers of goods and services. The standards outlined are applicable across the whole of the Goodwood Group and all our subsidiaries. The Group is based at the 12,000 acre Goodwood Estate in Chichester, West Sussex, from which it operates a wide range of luxury leisure, sporting and events businesses. To run these various operations we employ over 500 employees and casual workers at various points in our calendar. Due to the extremely varied nature of all our businesses we also deal with over hundreds of suppliers across a very wide range of business types. We want our customers to be confident that both we and our business partners share the same standards, values and commitment to treat all employees fairly, with respect for human rights, and to ensure that they are not exposed to unsafe working conditions or in any way forced to work under slavery. We only use reputable employment agencies to source labour. Once employed by us, employees are clearly notified of the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour expected of them, including when operating and managing our supply chains. We will raise the general awareness of modern slavery issues among our employees by providing relevant information via briefings. We will only deal with organisations who also commit to the eradication of slavery and human trafficking. To work towards achieving this, our due diligence process will incorporate a review of the controls undertaken by our suppliers and we will require them to commit to the provisions set out in our Business Code. Key supply chain managers will have responsibility for developing and operating company procedures relevant to the issue. \u001b[6;30;42mFurther and wider training will follow as and when identified.\n",

      "Genesco and its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Genesco\" or the \"Company\") sell consumer goods through both wholesale and retail channels. Its retail operations sell both merchandise manufactured to the Company’s order by unrelated contract manufacturers and bearing the Company’s owned or licensed brands, and merchandise manufactured for and purchased from unrelated wholesale distributors and bearing their brands.\n",
      "Ethical Sourcing Policy\n",
      "Genesco is committed to principles of ethical business practice and recognition of the dignity of others, including responsible labor practices. The same policies relating to slavery and forced labor apply across all of Genesco’s operations. We therefore discuss in this Statement our efforts to eradicate slavery and forced labor from our supply chains for goods offered for sale on an enterprise-wide basis. However, some of Genesco’s subsidiaries are not subject to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act.\n",
      "Genesco’s approach is to focus on its direct suppliers, since this is the level of the supply chain where Genesco believes that it has the most influence and can therefore be the most effective.\n",
      "Supplier Terms and Conditions\n",
      "In furtherance of the foregoing commitment, Genesco requires its vendors to warrant and represent that merchandise has been manufactured in compliance with the applicable laws of the United States and of the jurisdiction of manufacture, and without the use of slave or forced labor. Genesco's contracts of purchase require vendors to certify compliance with these standards and with terms of purchase which give the Company the right to audit compliance with its standards through its own employees or third parties.\n",
      "In its terms of purchase, Genesco reserves the right to terminate orders for merchandise from vendors found to violate its manufacturing standards, including those prohibiting slavery or forced labor, and the right to terminate the relationship with suppliers in violations of such standards.\n",
      "Site Visits and Audits\n",
      "Personnel from each of the Company's branded operations visit their respective operation’s tier-one manufacturing facilities to observe the manufacturing process in an effort to ensure compliance with manufacturing and quality standards, including labor standards. Additionally, some of the Company’s wholesale operations are parties to agreements under which independent third party inspectors conduct compliance audits to ensure compliance with manufacturing standards, including prohibitions on slave and forced labor. During the audit, the independent third party inspector will visit and inspect the tier-one manufacturing site, conduct interviews with supervisors, managers and employees of the facility, and review relevant books and records of the third party manufacturer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "In most instances, if a deficiency is identified, corrective action will be required on a specified timeline, followed by validation by the Company or its auditor that such deficiency has been remedied, including, if necessary through a re-audit of the manufacturer. In the case of a serious violation of the Company's standards, termination of the Company’s relationship with the manufacturer may occur, particularly where corrective action is either not possible or determined to be an insufficient remedy.\n",
      "Because of the number of and frequent change in unrelated vendors of manufactured goods and the competitive sensitivity of many of the vendors' manufacturing arrangements, the Company’s retail operations that sell merchandise primarily marketed under unrelated vendors' trademarks generally rely upon the vendors' representations and warranties regarding labor standards.\n",
